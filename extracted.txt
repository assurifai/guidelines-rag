Use of the Numbering System
The numbering system used to identify the levels of detail of the content contained within this Selling Guide can help the reader to navigate the Guide more easily and to recognize where a particular topic is contained within the content hierarchy.
Consider the numbering system identiﬁer for the topic “Requirements for Credit Reports”:
B3-5.2-01 Requirements for Credit Reports
Based on the information in the following table, the reader can use the numbering system identiﬁer to map the location and level of content within the Selling Guide.

Eﬀective Dates for the Selling Guide
Each topic within the Selling Guide is followed by a date shown in parentheses. Beginning with the publication of the 2009 Selling Guide, this date represents the date of the most recent Selling Guide announcement that amended content within an individual topic. The lender must refer to the individual Selling Guide announcement to determine the policy eﬀective date. Links to announcements in the past ﬁve years that amended the policies in that topic can be found in the Recent Related Announcements table at the end of each topic, as applicable.
Topic updates with older related announcements can be found in prior PDF versions of the Selling Guide in the Fannie Mae Selling and Servicing Policy Archives.
Amendments to the Selling Guide
Fannie Mae may at any time alter or waive any of the requirements of this Selling Guide, impose other additional requirements, or rescind or amend any and all material set forth in this Selling Guide. The lender must make sure that its staﬀ is thoroughly familiar with the content and requirements of this Selling Guide, as it now exists and as it may be changed from time to time.
Notiﬁcation of Changes and Updates
Fannie Mae notiﬁes lenders of changes and updates to selling policies and procedures through Selling Guide announcements, lender letters, and notices as described below:
Selling Guide Announcements – communicate policy changes that impact the Selling Guide and are incorporated into the Selling Guide on a monthly cycle. On occasion, a policy change may require immediate communication with Fannie Mae lenders and so is released "oﬀ-cycle" and incorporated into a future Selling Guide update. Announcements are numbered as: SEL-20XX-XX.
Lender letters – present new or modiﬁed policies and procedures that are not documented in the Guide, such as policy changes that are temporary in nature, reminders of existing policies, or upcoming Guide updates. Lender letters are numbered as: LL-20XX-XX.
Selling Notices – clarify or reiterate existing Selling Guide policies, provide advance notice of upcoming

changes, provide minor updates to procedures, notify lenders of updated forms or documents posted on Fannie Mae’s website, communicate extended expiration dates or other important information. While notices may refer to requirements in the Selling Guide, they do not revise or otherwise change these requirements and are not used to communicate new policies. Notices are identiﬁed by the date published (and are not numbered).
Announcements, lender letters, and notices are incorporated into the Guide by reference, and as such, are legally binding. Lender letters and notices continue to be in eﬀect until any sunset date speciﬁed in the lender letter or notice or until amended by a subsequent lender letter, notice, or announcement
Guide updates, announcements, lender letters, and notices are communicated to lenders in two ways:
posting the documents on Fannie Mae's website and the AllRegs® subscription website, and
email notiﬁcation to lenders that subscribe to Fannie Mae’s email subscription service and select the option “Selling News”.
Fannie Mae does not mail printed copies of Guide updates, announcements, lender letters, or notices. Lenders that want printed copies may download and print PDF ﬁles of the documents posted on Fannie Mae's website.
Exhibits, Forms, and Content Incorporated by Reference
Information about the speciﬁc forms that lenders must use in fulﬁlling the requirements contained in the Selling Guide is given in context within the Guide. Lenders can access the actual forms in several ways:
on Fannie Mae's website via the Guide Forms and Legal Documents pages, which provides a complete list of all forms and legal documents, or
on the AllRegs subscription website for users with a full subscription to AllRegs.
Some exhibits that relate to Fannie Mae policies and requirements are only referenced in the Selling Guide and are posted in their entirety on Fannie Mae's website. All materials referenced by hyperlink, such as forms, exhibits, and reference materials that are posted to Fannie Mae's website are incorporated by reference into the Selling Guide and are fully enforceable.
Guide Maintenance
Periodically non-policy related maintenance is needed to ensure the integrity of the Selling Guide. Examples of maintenance includes, updating or removing links to content that has been moved or deleted, modifying terminology to align with corporate branding, and incorporating new features to help improve the ease of navigating the Guide.
Technical Issues
In the event of technical diﬃculties or system failures with Fannie Mae's website or with delivery of the “Selling + Servicing News” option of Fannie Mae’s email subscription service, users may select the “Contact Us” link on the website.

Introduction This topic describes some of the seller’s, servicer’s and seller/servicer’s contractual arrangements, including:
Role of MSSC Special Seller/Servicer Approval and MSSC Addendum Lender Contract: Integration and Non-Divisibility Amendments to the Guides General Contract Terms
Role of MSSC
After Fannie Mae approves a seller or servicer or seller/servicer, both parties execute the Mortgage Selling and Servicing Contract (MSSC) and any other relevant agreements. The continuation of that relationship depends on both parties honoring the mutual promises in the Lender Contract.
The MSSC establishes the basic legal relationship between a seller, servicer or seller/servicer and Fannie Mae and
establishes the entity as an approved seller of mortgages and participation interests or an approved
Published February 5, 2025

servicer of mortgages or both; and
incorporates by reference the Selling Guide, the Servicing Guide, the Requirements for Document Custodians, the Consolidated Technology Guide, the Fannie Mae Information Security and Business Resiliency Supplement (the "Supplement"), Manuals, Announcements, Lender Letters, Release Notes, Notices, directives and other documents which may be incorporated by reference into the Guides, all as amended or supplemented from time to time.
Special Seller/Servicer Approval and MSSC Addendum
Certain loan types or processes require special approval. The following special approvals will be documented by an addendum to the Mortgage Selling and Servicing Contract (MSSC) between Fannie Mae and the seller/servicer:
co-op share loans,
HomeStyle Renovation mortgages,
electronic mortgages (eMortgages), and
bifurcation servicer in Servicing Marketplace (SMP).
Sellers/servicers may request approval to sell these loans or acquire servicing in SMP through their Fannie Mae customer account team. Sellers/servicers may not sell or service these loan types unless they obtain the applicable special approval and execute any additional agreements required by Fannie Mae. Sellers/servicers that apply for special approval to sell HomeStyle Renovation mortgages must also complete a Special Lender Approval Form (Form 1000A).
Fannie Mae reserves the right to cease approving sellers/servicers, or for purchasing any or all of the loan types listed above from any or all sellers/servicers, and to cease approving servicers for acquisition, or allowing the transfer of servicing in SMP. The decision to no longer purchase such loans or permit the acquisition of servicing in SMP may result in an amendment to, or the termination of, the special approval. Fannie Mae will provide the aﬀected seller/servicer with reasonable notice of this decision. If the decision aﬀects a seller/servicer's ability to fulﬁll any required mandatory delivery amount under its Lender Contract, Fannie Mae will consider alternatives through which the seller/servicer can fulﬁll its delivery obligation.
Lender Contract: Integration and Non-Divisibility
The MSSC and all the documents referenced above, together with any other agreements with Fannie Mae that provide for additional obligations to Fannie Mae, such as commitments, variances, special requirements, technology agreements, and collateral agreements, are together referred to as the “Lender Contract” and form a single, integrated contract.
A servicer or seller/servicer’s beneﬁts and obligations to service loans under the Lender Contract are integrated and cannot be separated from the seller’s or seller/servicer’s beneﬁts and obligations to sell loans under the Lender Contract.
Fannie Mae relies on this integration and non-divisibility in entering into, and continuing to be bound by, the
Published February 5, 2025

Lender Contract and in consenting to a servicing transfer.
Amendments to the Guides
All of Fannie Mae’s communications (Guides, Manuals, Announcements, Lender Letters, Release Notes, and Notices and directives) are incorporated into the Guides by reference, and are eﬀective on the dates speciﬁed in such documents. Certain information and requirements posted on Fannie Mae's website are also incorporated by reference into the Guides.
Fannie Mae transmits communications to sellers, servicers and seller/servicers by posting them on Fannie Mae’s corporate website (or other websites as Fannie Mae may establish in the future). Fannie Mae also publishes some communications (for convenience) via AllRegs.
General Contract Terms
The following table describes some general contract terms.

Delivery Methods True Sale
Delivery Methods
Sellers may sell loans to Fannie Mae using either of the two following delivery methods.
As whole loans - the seller sells the loans to Fannie Mae and receives cash proceeds in the amount of the purchase price, with the loans to be retained by Fannie Mae in its porftolio or to be included later in MBS pools formed by Fannie Mae.
As MBS loans - the sellers sells the loans which are conveyed to an MBS trust under the terms of the Fannie Mae MBS program and the seller (or its designee) receives mortgage pass-through certiﬁcates representing interests in the loans as the purchase price for the loans.
The term “delivery” refers to the delivery of whole loans to Fannie Mae and into MBS pools. In cases where speciﬁc requirements apply to one type of transaction, the delivery method is speciﬁed. The term “loan” means “mortgage loan” and includes participation interests in loans unless speciﬁed otherwise. The glossary deﬁnes terms used in connection with Fannie Mae requirements in the Selling Guide.

True Sale
Both Fannie Mae and the seller intend that every sale of loans to be the seller’s true, absolute, and unconditional sale to Fannie Mae of the loans. However, if a court or other appropriate forum holds the loans are still the seller’s property, then Fannie Mae and the seller intend that the transaction be deemed to be:
a pledge by the seller to secure a debt or other obligation owed to Fannie Mae for all related loans, and
a grant by the seller to Fannie Mae of a ﬁrst priority perfected security interest in the loans.
Accordingly, for each loan delivery, the seller grants Fannie Mae a security interest in all of the seller’s right, title, and interest in the loans sold to Fannie Mae. Such security interest secures the seller’s performance of all of its obligations to Fannie Mae pertaining to that loan or the contract under which it is sold to or serviced for Fannie Mae.
If the seller breaches its obligations to Fannie Mae, Fannie Mae may,
without a binding election of remedies, use the remedies provided by applicable law to the holder of a security interest; or
extinguish all equitable, legal, and other right, title, or interest of the seller in the pledged security and take such property as its property.

Chapter A2-2, Contractual Representations and Warranties
Introduction
This chapter includes information on the contractual and selling representations and warranties that lenders make when they deliver mortgage loans to Fannie Mae.
A2-2-01, Representations and Warranties Overview (02/05/2020)
Introduction This topic contains information on representations and warranties, including:
Overview Lender Reporting Requirements for Breach of Selling Warranty
Overview
In order to sell loans to Fannie Mae or deliver pools of loans to Fannie Mae for MBS, the lender makes representations and warranties as to certain facts and circumstances concerning the lender and the mortgage loans it is selling or delivering. The MSSC contains speciﬁc representations and warranties. Additional representations and warranties are contained in this Guide and elsewhere in the Lender Contract. Some of the representations and warranties relate to speciﬁc delivery options or mortgage products, and others to speciﬁc types of properties, mortgage documentation, or title issues. Some of the representation and warranties apply to every mortgage loan that is delivered to Fannie Mae, while others apply in special circumstances.
Violation of any representation or warranty is a breach of the Lender Contract, including the warranty that the loan complies with all applicable requirements of the Lender Contract, which provides Fannie Mae with certain rights and remedies.
All selling representations and warranties are made to Fannie Mae as of the date a lender transfers mortgage loans to Fannie Mae and continue and survive:
the sale of mortgage loans to Fannie Mae or delivery of pools of mortgage loans for Fannie Mae MBS,
any subsequent resale of the mortgage loans by Fannie Mae, and
termination of the MSSC and any agreement that is part of the Lender Contract unless Fannie Mae expressly releases the lender from them in writing.
The lender makes each representation and warranty set forth in the Lender Contract separately and independently from every other warranty it makes for a speciﬁc mortgage.
Representations and warranties are not limited to matters of which the lender had knowledge, except for the
Published February 5, 2025
14
warranties numbered 10, 11, and 17 of Section IV, A: Speciﬁc Warranties, of the MSSC, which are violated only if the lender had knowledge of the untruth or, acting as a prudent lender, should have known about it through the exercise of due diligence. Although warranty number 17 is limited to matters of which the lender has knowledge or, as a prudent lender, should have discovered, this limitation does not in any way limit the lender’s warranty number 1 that the mortgage meets all applicable requirements in the Lender Contract, nor does it aﬀect any other warranty. Lenders are deemed to know matters that are of public record.
Because the selling warranties are not limited to matters within a lender’s knowledge, except as noted above, the action or inaction (including misrepresentation or fraud) of the borrower, or a third party, as well as the action or inaction (including misrepresentation or fraud) of the lender will constitute the lender’s breach of a selling warranty.
A lender that acquires the servicing of a mortgage loan, either concurrently with or subsequent to Fannie Mae’s purchase of the mortgage loan, assumes and is responsible for the same selling warranties that the party responsible for the selling representations and warranties made when the mortgage loan was sold to Fannie Mae. When a servicer transfers its contractual right to service some or all of its servicing responsibilities to another Fannie Mae-approved servicer, any variance or waiver granted to a transferor servicer does not automatically transfer to the transferee servicer. In addition, the transferor servicer and transferee servicer must ensure that all existing special servicing obligations associated with the transferred mortgage loan are disclosed.
Note: Fannie Mae will not exercise its rights to enforce certain remedies for breaches of certain representations and warranties for loans meeting the requirements set forth in A2-2-04, Limited Waiver and Enforcement Relief of Representations and Warranties, and A2-3.2-02, Enforcement Relief for Breaches of Certain Representations and Warranties Related to Underwriting and Eligibility.
Lender Reporting Requirements for Breach of Selling Warranty
The lender must notify Fannie Mae within 30 days if, after conducting due diligence, it determines that a breach of a selling warranty has likely occurred, by using the self-report functionality in Loan Quality Connect. For additional information on a lender’s responsibilities for self-reporting to Fannie Mae, refer to D1-3-06, Lender Post-Closing Quality Control Reporting, Record Retention, and Audit. For additional information on a lender’s reporting responsibilities with respect to misrepresentation or fraud, refer to A3-4-03, Preventing, Detecting, and Reporting Mortgage Fraud.

A2-2-02, Delivery Information and Delivery-Option Speciﬁc
Representations and Warranties (08/30/2016)
Introduction This topic covers delivery information and delivery-option speciﬁc representations and warranties, including:
Mortgage Loan Delivery MBS Pool Delivery Representations and Warranties Representation and Warranty Requirements for the Sale and Servicing of All Mortgages
Mortgage Loan Delivery
Regardless of the delivery option, the lender represents and warrants that all required mortgage loan delivery data is true, correct, and complete, even for such data elements that are not required to qualify a borrower or underwrite a loan. The lender also represents and warrants that at the time Fannie Mae releases cash or MBS in exchange for the mortgage loan, no person has any right of rescission pursuant to the Truth in Lending Act or other law which has not expired or otherwise terminated.
For purchase money loans and also for loans that have a right of rescission that has been waived, a lender may not request or receive cash or MBS until at least one business day after the lender disburses the funds to (or on behalf of) the borrower.
MBS Pool Delivery Representations and Warranties
The lender makes the following additional representations and warranties when it sells Fannie Mae a mortgage loan that is included as part of an MBS pool delivery:
the mortgage loan, or participation interest, conforms to the requirements and speciﬁcations for mortgage loans that are pooled to back MBS issues and the pool formation criteria of the speciﬁc MBS pool in which the mortgage loan is included (see C3-3, MBS Guaranty Fees and Guaranty Fee Buyups and Buydowns),
the mortgage satisﬁes the general mortgage loan eligibility requirements and underwriting guidelines for mortgage loans delivered to Fannie Mae (see C3-3, MBS Guaranty Fees and Guaranty Fee Buyups and Buydowns),
the description of the mortgage loan, or participation interest, described in the applicable Schedule of Mortgages is true and correct, and
all owners named in the Delivery Schedule (Form 2014) were provided the most recent prospectus, and any applicable prospectus supplement, available for the MBS program at the time they entered into their contract for the purchase of the related securities.
When the lender sells Fannie Mae an MBS pool that includes mortgage loans with special product characteristics that make them subject to delivery limitations, the lender represents and warrants that no more than 10% of
Published February 5, 2025
16
the aggregate issue date principal balance of the pool is composed of mortgage loans that have one of the special product characteristics. If mortgage loans with more than one of the special characteristics are included in the same pool, the lender warrants that the total amount of mortgage loans with special product characteristics in the pool does not exceed 15% of the aggregate issue date principal balance of the pool.
If a mortgage loan in an MBS pool has achieved enforcement relief as provided in A2-3.2-02, Enforcement Relief for Breaches of Certain Representations and Warranties Related to Underwriting and Eligibility, then the obligation to indemnify Fannie Mae is limited in certain respects. See A2-1-03, Indemniﬁcation for Losses, for a description of the continuing indemniﬁcation obligations.
Representation and Warranty Requirements for the Sale and Servicing of All Mortgages
By submitting any loan to Fannie Mae under any execution, including MBS, whole mortgage loan, or a participation pool mortgage to Fannie Mae as a whole loan, the lender represents and warrants that
all right, title, and interest in the mortgage loan is sold, transferred, set over, and otherwise conveyed by the lender to Fannie Mae as of the date Fannie Mae funds the purchase proceeds;
there is no agreement with any other party providing for servicing the mortgages that continues after such date unless there is full compliance with all the Fannie Mae Guide requirements for subservicing (see A3-3-03, Other Servicing Arrangements, and the Servicing Guide) or any prior servicing agreement is made expressly subject to Fannie Mae’s rights as owner of the mortgage loans; and
it is aware of all matters related to the mortgage that were known to the originating lender.
The party that was servicing for the lender prior to the transfer of the loan to Fannie Mae may become a servicer for Fannie Mae, if there is full compliance with all the Fannie Mae Guide requirements that provide for either
the assignment of servicing from the lender concurrent with conveyance of the mortgage to Fannie Mae (see A3-3-02, Concurrent Servicing Transfers), or
post-delivery transfers of servicing (see the applicable section of the Servicing Guide).
When Fannie Mae consents to a transfer of servicing by a lender or servicer, it relies on the integration and non- divisibility of the Lender Contract. Fannie Mae requires that the transferor lender remain obligated for all selling and servicing representations and warranties and recourse obligations upon the transfer of servicing. Fannie Mae also requires that the transferee servicer, whether the original seller or a transferee servicer, undertake and assume joint and several liability for all selling and servicing representations and warranties and recourse obligations related to the mortgage loans it services unless explicitly agreed to the contrary in writing by Fannie Mae.

A2-2-03, Document Warranties (10/06/2021)
Introduction This topic contains information on document warranties, including:
Legal Document Warranties Nonstandard Documents
Legal Document Warranties
Document warranties relate to legal documents used for a mortgage, such as security instruments, notes, and assignments.
Nonstandard Documents
When a lender sells Fannie Mae mortgage loans that are closed on legal documents other than the current Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac uniform instruments, or current Fannie Mae instruments that are applicable to the transaction, the lender warrants that the mortgage loans otherwise comply with the Lender Contract. The use of nonstandard instruments will not preclude it or any subsequent servicer from performing all servicing and accounting functions required by Fannie Mae’s Guides. By delivering loans not closed on current Fannie Mae instruments, the lender represents and warrants as follows:
Applicable laws and regulations, enforceability, negotiability — No term of the instruments violates applicable laws and regulations, each and every term of the instruments is fully enforceable under applicable laws and regulations, and the mortgage note constitutes a negotiable instrument under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) of the applicable jurisdiction(s).
Deﬁnition of security property — The deﬁnition of security property conforms to the deﬁnition used in the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac uniform instruments, and must include all improvements erected on the property (at the time the document is executed and in the future), easements, appurtenances, ﬁxtures that are part of the property (at the time the document is executed and in the future), and replacements and additions to such improvements, appurtenances, and ﬁxtures.
Personal property/principal residence — A one-unit property that is the borrower’s principal residence may not include personal property or other items (such as appliances, furniture, or equipment) that might be considered as additional security.
Mortgage loans secured by a two- to four-unit principal residence or an investment property — If personal property is pledged, it may be to the same extent as it is pledged by the 1-4 Family Rider (Form 3170).
Due on Sale — The instruments for ﬁxed-rate conventional mortgage loans include a fully enforceable due-on-sale or due-on-transfer clause, except as limited by federal law.
“Default” rate of interest — The instruments do not include a “default” rate of interest provision.
Rights similar to those in Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Uniform Instrument — The instruments do not
Published February 5, 2025
18
grant more favorable rights to the borrower on default and foreclosure, or less favorable rights to the note holder with respect to property insurance (including both required insurance and insurance the borrower elects to obtain), leasehold interests, other liens on the property, condemnation proceedings, or other proceedings that result in a full or partial taking of the property, or any other compensation, settlement, or award of damages that is the result of damage to, or destruction of, the property than those granted in the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac uniform instruments for the applicable jurisdiction(s).
Waivers of Rights of Redemption — The instruments include a speciﬁc waiver by the borrower, and, if applicable, the borrower’s spouse, of:
any legally waivable statutory right of redemption after foreclosure,
Note: Statutory rights of redemption that are not waivable under applicable law are acceptable only to the extent the instruments do not grant more favorable rights to the borrower on default and foreclosure than those granted in the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac uniform instruments for the applicable jurisdiction.
any right of homestead, dower, or similar marital right, and
rights of presentment and notice of dishonor, if a waiver of rights is necessary to protect the note holder’s interest.
Right to advance — The instruments expressly allow the note holder to advance at any time sums for unpaid insurance premiums, property taxes, or any other payments necessary to protect the value of the property or the note holder’s rights in the property and permit the note holder to collect such amounts from the borrower on a deferred basis.
Note holder actions to protect the property — The instruments permit the note holder to undertake certain actions to protect the property, including securing and repairing the property if it has been abandoned, and to add the costs of these actions to the amount of the debt.
Actions note holder is not obligated to take — The instruments do not obligate the note holder to
advance additional principal sums,
forgive or suspend fully or partially scheduled installments or any portion of them for the borrower’s beneﬁt, or
apply any prior principal prepayment to reduce or cure the borrower’s delinquency.
Fixed interest rate and level principal and interest payments — The instruments provide for ﬁxed interest rates and level principal and interest payments, unless the mortgage loan is an adjustable-rate mortgage.
Replacement Index and Replacement Margin — The instruments for ARM loans include the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) recommended fallback contract language for new closed- end, residential ARMs. (See, for example, the Multistate Adjustable-Rate Note 30-Day Average SOFR (Form 3441), paragraph 4.G. Replacement Index and Replacement Margin.)
Maturity date — The instruments specify a maturity date. If the instruments do not specify a maturity date, the lender warrants that:
the mortgage loan will be fully amortized during a speciﬁed original term with no subsequent adjustments to the amount payable;
the entire indebtedness, including any amount previously added to the mortgage loan balance and the principal and interest payments, will be secured by the mortgage loan and take priority over
Published February 5, 2025
19
intervening liens;
the lien of the mortgage loan is a valid ﬁrst lien; and
the priority of the mortgage lien at the time of delivery will not be diminished over the term of the mortgage loan and, during that time, all sums, including any sums previously added to the mortgage loan balance, will be repaid in monthly installments.
Notice of grievance — The instruments require the lender and the borrower to give the other party a notice of any grievance arising under the security instrument and to allow the notiﬁed party a reasonable period after receipt of the notiﬁcation to cure the grievance before the party providing the notice commences, joins, or is joined to a judicial action, as either an individual litigant or as a member of a litigant class that seeks redress or recovery in connection with the grievance.
Maintenance of property — The instruments obligate the borrower to maintain the property in a way that prevents deterioration and to repair promptly any damage to the property, whether or not such damage is covered by insurance.
Mortgage Insurance — The instruments provide that the lender, any purchaser of the mortgage note, a mortgage insurer other than the insurer of the mortgage, any reinsurer, or any other entity (including an aﬃliate of any of the foregoing) may receive (directly or indirectly) amounts that derive from (or might be characterized as) a portion of the borrower’s payments for the mortgage insurance in exchange for sharing or modifying the mortgage insurer’s risk or otherwise reducing losses.
Borrower’s failure to take a future action — The instrument (or any other agreement that the borrower signed) does not provide that the borrower’s failure to take a future action requested by the lender (such as providing and paying for additional documentation for the transaction after the date of loan closing) constitutes a default. Alternatively, if the instrument does include such a provision, the lender will not enforce it.

Limited Waiver of Representations and Warranties for Loan Caseﬁles Submitted to DU
Fannie Mae grants a limited waiver of certain underwriting representations and warranties to a lender that sells an eligible mortgage that is underwritten with DU.
If DU returns an Approve/Eligible recommendation on the ﬁnal submission of the loan caseﬁle to DU, then Fannie Mae will not require the lender to represent and warrant that the mortgage loan complies with the requirements of this Guide with regard to the mortgage loan’s eligibility for delivery to Fannie Mae and the borrower’s creditworthiness, provided that:
All data pertaining to the mortgage loan is complete, accurate, and not fraudulent, and all data on which the underwriting recommendation was based reﬂects the ﬁnal terms of the closed mortgage loan, and otherwise comply with the requirements relating to submissions and resubmissions as stated in this Guide and any relevant supplemental materials.
All data on which DU’s recommendation is based complies with Fannie Mae’s veriﬁcation requirements and the mortgage loan ﬁle is documented accordingly.
The lender uses the appropriate special feature codes, as speciﬁed in the delivery reporting requirements of this Guide or elsewhere in the Lender Contract. SFC 127 is required for all loans underwritten through DU.
All Veriﬁcation Messages/Approval Conditions that appear in the DU Underwriting Findings report with respect to the related mortgage loan application must be satisfactorily resolved, and the mortgage loan ﬁle documented accordingly.
All other requirements, instructions, and restrictions set forth in this Guide and any release notes are complied with by the lender (or DU licensee).
The lender reports the proper DU-assigned unique loan caseﬁle ID at the time of delivery on the appropriate loan schedule or schedule of mortgages. (A DU loan caseﬁle ID is unique to an individual mortgage loan. The same caseﬁle ID may not be used to underwrite more than one mortgage loan to DU.)

A2-2-05, Invalidation of Limited Waiver of Representations and
Warranties (01/27/2015)
Introduction This topic contains information on invalidation of the limited waiver of representations and warranties for mortgage loans underwritten through DU, including:
Overview Lenders That Sell or Assign Loans Underwritten Through DU Lenders That Acquire Loans Underwritten with DU
Overview
For loans submitted to DU for evaluation, the lender must review the entire underwriting ﬁle to determine whether it includes any data or other information that was either not submitted to DU, or is inconsistent with any data or information that was in fact submitted to DU. If any such information (especially of a derogatory or contradictory nature) is found, the lender must take appropriate action, such as further investigating the information, to see if it would change the DU recommendation, or setting aside the DU recommendation if there are grounds for the lender to arrive at an underwriting decision other than the one it reached on the basis of the original DU recommendation. In such cases, the limited waiver of representations and warranties will no longer be valid for a mortgage that had received an Approve/Eligible recommendation.
Fannie Mae generally places no restrictions on the sale or transfer of loans underwritten through DU to third parties either before or after the mortgage is closed, other than a requirement that the sale or transfer must be in compliance with all applicable laws. When the limited waiver of representations and warranties is transferable, the selling or transferring lender must fully disclose (1) the fact that the mortgage was submitted to DU for evaluation, and (2) the nature of the DU recommendation. The selling or transferring lender also must include in the mortgage ﬁle that it transfers to the new lender the DU Underwriting Findings report and the corresponding DU Underwriting Analysis report (as well as any other pertinent DU reports).

Lenders That Sell or Assign Loans Underwritten Through DU
A lender that sells or assigns loans underwritten through DU must modify its assignment letters or loan sale agreements to set out instances in which a mortgage that was eligible for a limited waiver of representations and warranties may no longer be considered eligible. Situations that aﬀect the continued eligibility of a mortgage for a limited waiver of representations and warranties include, but are not limited to, the following:
a signiﬁcant change that makes the information on which the DU recommendation was based no longer true, complete, or accurate.
the elapse of 12 months since the mortgage was originated makes the mortgage subject to Fannie Mae’s standard eligibility requirements for seasoned mortgages.
a determination that the terms of the closed mortgage are substantially diﬀerent from those on which the DU recommendation was based or that the DU recommendation was based on incorrect information.
Lenders That Acquire Loans Underwritten with DU
A lender that acquires loans underwritten with DU must include in its QC processes appropriate procedures to:
verify that any conditions speciﬁed in the DU Underwriting Findings report have been satisﬁed, and
conﬁrm that the data from the closed mortgage agrees with the documents and all DU reports that are in the loan caseﬁle.
If there are inconsistencies between the data from the closed mortgage and the data on which DU’s recommendation was based, the limited waiver of representations and warranties will not apply—unless the lender either:
submits corrected information for the closed mortgage to DU for evaluation (if it is a licensee) and receives an Approve/Eligible recommendation ; or
requests the licensee that originally submitted the mortgage to DU to re-enter the correct information for the mortgage into DU (if permitted by applicable law) for the production of new reports and analyses to conﬁrm that the recommendation is still Approve/Eligible for the limited waiver. The lender should request that both the results of the resubmission and all new reports be sent to it.

Representations and Warranties Related to Collateral Underwriter (CU) Representations and Warranties Related to Value Acceptance
Representations and Warranties Related to Collateral Underwriter (CU)
In addition to the limited waiver of underwriting representations and warranties available for certain DU loans, loans may also beneﬁt from enforcement relief of certain representations and warranties related to the appraisal and value of the subject property (without regard to underwriting method). To be eligible for relief:
the loan must be secured by a one-unit detached, attached, or condo property (manufactured homes are not eligible); and
the appraisal must receive a CU risk score of 2.5 or below.
Note: See B4-1.1-04, Unacceptable Appraisal Practices for examples of unacceptable practices.
When this criteria is met, the lender is not responsible for the following requirements described in this Guide:
underwriting the appraisal report to determine whether the subject property presents adequate collateral for the mortgage;
ensuring the appraisal accurately reﬂects the market value of the property;
ensuring the appraiser used sound reasoning and provided evidence to support the methodology chosen to develop the opinion of value; and
analyzing the comparable sales used in the appraisal report, including the description, selection, adjustments, and reconciliation of the comparables.
The lender remains responsible for the description of the property, adherence to fair lending, local, state, and federal laws and the accuracy and completeness of all data on the appraisal that pertains to the property and project (if applicable). This includes the property’s condition and quality ratings. The lender is also responsible for ensuring the property meets the property eligibility requirements in this Guide. Lastly, the lender remains responsible for any life-of-loan representations and warranties that may apply to the property or the appraisal.
Representations and Warranties Related to Value Acceptance
In addition to the limited waiver of underwriting representations and warranties available for certain DU loans, when a loan caseﬁle is eligible for value acceptance (appraisal waiver), value acceptance + property data, or rural high-needs value acceptance (appraisal waiver), and is exercised by the lender, Fannie Mae accepts the

28
value estimate submitted by the lender as the value for the subject property. The property value the lender enters in DU may be based on:
the lender’s estimate of value, determined at the discretion of the lender, or
the borrower’s estimate of value.
For all value acceptance oﬀers that are exercised, the lender remains responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all data that pertains to the property and project (if applicable) that is submitted to DU (other than the property value) and must warrant that the property is adequately insured.
The following table describes the representations and warranties the lender must make ("Yes") if they exercise a value acceptance (appraisal waiver), value acceptance + property data, or rural-high needs value acceptance (appraisal waiver) oﬀer. The table also identiﬁes the representations and warranties the lender is not responsible for ("No").

Overview
In order to sell loans to Fannie Mae or deliver pools of loans to Fannie Mae for MBS, the lender makes representations and warranties as to certain facts and circumstances concerning the lender and the mortgage loans it is selling or delivering. Fannie Mae provides lenders with relief from enforcement for breaches of certain underwriting and eligibility representations and warranties for loans meeting the requirements set forth in A2-3.2-02, Enforcement Relief for Breaches of Certain Representations and Warranties Related to Underwriting and Eligibility (“enforcement relief”). No enforcement relief is available for certain “life-of-loan” representations and warranties.
Life-of-Loan Representations and Warranties
A lender is not relieved from the enforcement of breaches of its representations and warranties on any mortgage loan, including eligible mortgage loans, with respect to the following matters even if those matters are addressed in Subparts B1 through B5 of the Selling Guide (the subparts that pertain to underwriting and eligibility). With respect to each mortgage loan, a lender remains responsible throughout the life of that loan for representations and warranties related to the following, as more fully described below:

Life-of-Loan Exclusions: Fannie Mae Charter Act Matters
The lender is responsible for representations and warranties for the life of the loan for compliance with Fannie Mae's Charter Act. In accordance with its Charter Act requirements, a mortgage loan (or any participation interest therein) must meet all of the following requirements to be eligible for sale to Fannie Mae:
be secured by property that is residential in nature. Properties that are not residential include, but are not limited to, vacant land, property primarily used for agricultural or commercial purposes, or units located in condo or co-op hotels;
be secured by a property located within the 50 states of the United States of America, the District of Columbia, or any territory or possession of the United States;
be secured by a property with four or fewer units, unless sold through Fannie Mae’s multifamily mortgage business;
have an original principal balance not greater than the applicable maximum loan limit in eﬀect at the time of Fannie Mae’s acquisition; and
have a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 80% or less of the security property’s value at the time Fannie Mae acquires the loan or, if the mortgage has an LTV ratio in excess of 80%, the mortgage
has mortgage insurance on the portion of the mortgage in excess of 80% of the property's value provided by a mortgage insurer approved under Fannie Mae’s Qualiﬁed Mortgage Insurer Approval Requirements;
was sold with recourse for such period and under such circumstances as Fannie Mae may require; or
was sold on a participation basis when the lender retains a minimum 10% interest.
Example
An example of a breach of Charter Act requirements is a mortgage loan secured by a property that consists of a principal residence and a dairy farm, resulting in the property having signiﬁcant nonresidential use.
Life-of-Loan Exclusions: Misstatements, Misrepresentations, and Omissions
Even if a mortgage loan has met the requirements for enforcement relief set forth in A2-3.2-02, Enforcement Relief for Breaches of Certain Representations and Warranties Related to Underwriting and Eligibility, the lender remains responsible throughout the life of the loan for representations and warranties related to misstatements, misrepresentations, and omissions as set forth below.
Published February 5, 2025
31
In connection with a mortgage loan that has qualiﬁed for relief under the framework, “misrepresentations” means any misstatements, misrepresentations, or omissions by any party to the loan transaction made with or without the lender’s knowledge that pertain to the borrower, the property, or the project as set forth in Subparts B1 through B5 of the Selling Guide. Parties to the loan transaction include, but are not limited to, borrowers, property sellers, builders, real estate agents, lenders including the selling lender, mortgage brokers, loan oﬃcers, originators, appraisers, appraisal companies, closing agents, title companies, or other third-party vendors performing origination services. Fannie Mae will only assert a remedy for a misrepresentation involving a loan that has qualiﬁed for relief under the framework if all of the following criteria have been met. The misrepresentation must
involve three or more mortgage loans delivered to Fannie Mae by the same lender;
be made pursuant to a common pattern of activity in connection with loan origination or sale, based on information in the loan ﬁle or other facts or circumstances that existed at the time of delivery of the loan to Fannie Mae, which involves at least one party common to all the loans;
if the selling lender is the common party, involves the same individual; or,
if a third party is the common party, involves the same individual or entity; and
be “signiﬁcant,” as deﬁned below.
Note: In identifying three or more loans to constitute the pattern, Fannie Mae may count loans that have obtained relief under the framework and loans that have not obtained such relief. Each loan in the pattern must meet all the requirements above in order for Fannie Mae to enforce a remedy pursuant to this life-of-loan exclusion.
A misrepresentation (as deﬁned above) is “signiﬁcant” if Fannie Mae, using true and accurate information, determines
that the loan would not have been eligible for sale to Fannie Mae under the terms of the lender’s contract with Fannie Mae in eﬀect at the time of delivery of the loan, or
that the loan would have been eligible for purchase, but under diﬀerent terms.
In making this determination of signiﬁcance, Fannie Mae will rely upon a DU simulator. The DU simulator will use the true and accurate loan information to approximate the DU recommendation as of the time of delivery and compare it to the DU recommendation the lender obtained in the ﬁnal DU loan submission before delivery. If the loan originally did not have a DU recommendation, the DU simulator will compare the new DU recommendation to the DU recommendation the loan would have received using the data provided at delivery, had the lender used DU.
A misrepresentation will be considered “signiﬁcant” for purposes of the life-of-loan test, and the lender will be required to repurchase the loan only if the loan receives a worse DU recommendation from the simulator than it received (or would have received) at the time of delivery to Fannie Mae, except that Fannie Mae will also take into account any applicable variance and the impact of any undisclosed concessions, concealed transaction terms, or other violations of the lender’s contract (including Selling Guide requirements) that are involved in the misrepresentation, but are not evaluated by the DU simulator, when determining signiﬁcance. Fannie Mae will notify the lender of any such undisclosed matters or violations that are considered in connection with determining such signiﬁcance. Fannie Mae will provide the lender with documentation supporting the signiﬁcance determination.
Published February 5, 2025
32
If Fannie Mae determines that the loan would have been eligible for purchase under diﬀerent terms than those under which the loan was sold, Fannie Mae will not seek repurchase, but instead will re-price the loan, consistent with the lender’s contract at the time of loan delivery, to reﬂect the true risk proﬁle of the loan.
Fraud. A mortgage loan involving fraud will be subject to repurchase, regardless of whether the standards described above (that is, the number of aﬀected loans, a common pattern of activity, and a signiﬁcance determination) have been met. For purposes of this life-of-loan exclusion only, fraud is established either by
an adjudicated claim aﬃrming fraud by or against the lender or other party to the loan transaction; or
Fannie Mae ﬁnding clear and convincing evidence that the lender or other party to the loan transaction knowingly executed or participated in a scheme or artiﬁce in connection with the underwriting, origination, or sale of a loan in order to
defraud Fannie Mae or any other party to the loan transaction; or
obtain any moneys, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other properties from Fannie Mae or any other party to the loan transaction by means of fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.
Note: Lenders continue, at all times, to be responsible for any misstatement, misrepresentation, or omission in connection with any matter not relieved under the framework (that is, not addressed in Subparts B1 through B5 of the Selling Guide). Mortgage loans are subject at all times to Fannie Mae’s standard requirements related to fraud, misstatements, misrepresentations, or omissions as described in the Selling Guide, A3-4-03, Preventing, Detecting, and Reporting Mortgage Fraud.The lender is required to report suspected mortgage fraud whenever a reasonable basis exists to conclude that it may have occurred, regardless of whether the loan has obtained relief or Fannie Mae may require the lender to repurchase the loan.
Examples
The following examples illustrate some instances of application of this life-of-loan exclusion:
An example of a misstatement in which the lender may be required to repurchase loans even if the loans have obtained relief:
In order to qualify borrowers in four separate home purchase transactions, the same loan oﬃcer employed by a lender understates the liabilities of the borrowers in each DU submission, aﬀecting the debt-to-income ratio in each instance. The lender sells all four loans to Fannie Mae. The pattern of understatements comes to light after the loans have obtained relief under the framework. Fannie Mae utilizes the DU simulator, applying the DU rules that were in place at the time of delivery of each loan and the correct amount of total borrower liabilities. The DU simulator provides an “ineligible” recommendation for each of the four loans. In this instance, the lender must repurchase the four loans, if requested, despite the fact that the loans obtained relief.
An example of an omission in which the lender may be required to repurchase the mortgage loans even if the loans have obtained relief:
In order to sell newly-built homes more quickly, a real estate agent and a property developer provide each borrower in three separate transactions with a $15,000 rebate outside of closing that is not disclosed in the sales contracts or in the settlement statements. All three loans are sold to Fannie Mae by the same lender. This practice is in violation of Fannie Mae's undisclosed interested party contributions policy. Had these rebates been taken into account, each of the loans would have failed to qualify for
Published February 5, 2025
33
purchase by Fannie Mae. Though this policy is not evaluated by, or able to aﬀect the results of, the DU simulator, noncompliance makes the loans ineligible for delivery. In this instance, the lender must repurchase the three loans, if requested, even if the loans have obtained relief.
An example of fraud in which the lender may be required to repurchase a single mortgage loan because of clear and convincing evidence of a scheme or artiﬁce to defraud:
A borrower borrows $10,000 from a friend as part of a down payment on a home. He has secretly promised to pay the friend back with interest. The borrower provides a falsiﬁed gift letter to the lender documenting a $10,000 gift from an uncle. The lender would be required, if requested, to repurchase the loan if Fannie Mae subsequently can demonstrate that part of the down payment was borrowed—even if the loan had obtained relief. Because the borrower’s misstatement to the lender involved the knowingly executed scheme or artiﬁce to obtain a loan by use of fraudulently fabricated evidence that supports an incorrect factual representation made by the borrower, the loan is subject to repurchase, despite not involving a pattern of activity aﬀecting three or more loans or meeting the “signiﬁcance” test.
Life-of-Loan Exclusions: Data Inaccuracies
Lenders are responsible for supplying Fannie Mae with high-quality, accurate, and complete data through a variety of systems, including but not limited to, Fannie Mae’s whole loan committing application, DU, and Loan Delivery. (See A3-4-02, Data Quality and Integrity, for additional information.)
Even if a mortgage loan has met the requirements for enforcement relief set forth in A2-3.2-02, Enforcement Relief for Breaches of Certain Representations and Warranties Related to Underwriting and Eligibility, the lender remains responsible throughout the life of the loan for representations and warranties related to data accuracy as set forth below. In connection with mortgage loans delivered to Fannie Mae, there must not be delivery data (Uniform Loan Delivery Dataset) inaccuracies pertaining to the borrower, the property, or the project, if and to the extent
the data inaccuracies aﬀect ﬁve or more loans and involve the same delivery data element(s);
such delivery data diﬀer from the information documented in the lender's mortgage loan ﬁles; and
the data inaccuracies are “signiﬁcant,” in that, using the information of the loan ﬁle to qualify the borrower, property, and project,
the loan would not have been eligible for delivery under the terms of the lender’s contracts with Fannie Mae in eﬀect at the time of delivery of the loan; or
the loan would have been eligible for sale to Fannie Mae, but under diﬀerent terms.
Note: In identifying ﬁve or more loans involving the same data element inaccuracy, Fannie Mae may count loans that have obtained relief under the framework and loans that have not obtained such relief. Each loan in the pattern must meet all the requirements above in order for Fannie Mae to enforce a remedy.
In determining whether the data inaccuracies are “signiﬁcant” for purposes of the life-of-loan test, Fannie Mae will rely upon the DU simulator. The DU simulator will use the true and accurate loan information to approximate the DU recommendation as of the time of delivery and compare it to the DU recommendation the lender obtained in the ﬁnal DU loan submission before delivery. If the loan originally did not have a DU recommendation, the DU simulator will compare the new DU recommendation to the DU recommendation the loan would have received using the data provided at delivery, had the lender used DU.
Published February 5, 2025
34
A data inaccuracy will be considered signiﬁcant and the lender will be required to repurchase the loan only if the loan receives a worse DU risk assessment from the simulator than it received (or would have received) at the time of delivery to Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae will also take into account any applicable variance entered into with the lender when determining such signiﬁcance. Fannie Mae will provide the lender with documentation supporting the signiﬁcance determination.
If Fannie Mae determines that the loan would have been eligible for purchase using the accurate information from the loan ﬁle but under diﬀerent terms than those under which the loan was sold, Fannie Mae will not seek repurchase, but will instead re-price the loan, consistent with the lender’s contract at the time of loan delivery, to reﬂect the true risk proﬁle of the loan.
Examples
The following examples illustrate instances of application of this life-of-loan exclusion:
In connection with a system upgrade, a coding error is introduced into a lender’s system such that the representative credit score is incorrectly calculated. The lender reports inaccurate representative credit scores at loan delivery for ﬁve or more loans. After the loans obtain relief, a review of the credit reports in the lender’s origination ﬁles shows that for these mortgages, the actual representative credit scores were lower than those reﬂected in the data provided at delivery. The DU simulator, using the actual representative credit scores, produces an “ineligible” recommendation for each loan. The lender must repurchase the aﬀected loans, if requested, despite the fact that the loans have obtained relief.
For unknown reasons over a period of time, the lender’s origination system indicated that TILA-exempt investment property loans were principal residences. This error was reﬂected both in the DU submission and in the ULDD data at delivery for 30 loans. After the loans obtained relief, a review of the documentation in the lender’s loan ﬁles uncovers the error. The DU simulator, using the correct, revised data, produces an “Approve/Eligible” recommendation on 20 of the loans and a “Refer with Caution/Ineligible” recommendation on the other 10 loans. Fannie Mae will not require the lender to repurchase the 20 loans, but may assess increased loan-level price adjustments to reﬂect their actual risk. However, if requested, the lender must repurchase the 10 loans that received a “Refer with Caution/Ineligible” recommendation.
Life-of-Loan Exclusions: Clear Title/First-Lien Enforceability
The lender is responsible for representations and warranties for the life of the loan that pertain to clear title and ﬁrst-lien enforceability. A mortgage loan must
be sold by a lender that was the sole owner and holder of the mortgage loan and had the full right and authority to sell and assign it, or a participation interest therein, to Fannie Mae. The lender’s right to sell or assign the mortgage loan cannot be subject to any other party’s interest or to an agreement with any other party;
be a valid and subsisting ﬁrst lien enforceable in accordance with its terms (with no pending condemnation or other legal proceedings) and that otherwise meets Fannie Mae’s requirements for loan documents;
have a mortgagee policy of title insurance meeting Fannie Mae’s requirements, or other title evidence acceptable to Fannie Mae. Lenders continue to be responsible for all warranties related to title, marketability, and lien position, regardless of whether included or excluded by coverage under a
Published February 5, 2025
35
mortgagee policy of title insurance. Any defect shown on the title policy would not be considered to be an acceptable minor impediment if there was additional cost or delay involved in curing such defect;
permit foreclosure or other enforcement of the note holder’s rights under the loan documents and acquisition of good and marketable title to the underlying security property without incurring any expenses or delays as a result of any matters aﬀecting title to the property, including legal or land use restrictions or other defects relating to the land or location of the improvements.
Examples
Examples of a breach of these clear title/ﬁrst-lien enforceability requirements include, but are not limited to, the following:
Another party, such as a warehouse lender, asserts a claim to or interest in the loan.
Fannie Mae is unable to obtain clear title to the property because it is not in ﬁrst-lien position.
The lender fails to properly endorse the note or to adhere to requirements for the use of powers of attorney.
A mortgage loan is delivered to Fannie Mae with a Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) loan secured by the same property and the mortgage loan does not meet Fannie Mae’s eligibility requirements for mortgages delivered with PACE loans.
Improvements that were included in the appraised value of the property do not fall totally within the property’s boundaries or building restriction lines and were not otherwise permitted encroachments under the terms of the Selling Guide.
A mortgage loan is delivered to Fannie Mae that is secured by a property encumbered by private transfer fee covenants that do not meet Fannie Mae’s requirements.
Life-of-Loan Exclusions: Compliance with Laws and Responsible Lending Practices
The lender is responsible for representations and warranties for the life of the loan that pertain to compliance with laws and responsible lending practices. A mortgage loan must be originated in compliance with
applicable laws and regulations as set forth in A3-2-01, Compliance With Laws;
Fannie Mae’s responsible lending policies as set forth in A3-2-02, Responsible Lending Practices; and
policies adopted by Fannie Mae to implement or comply with directives or regulations issued by FHFA, including the following:
Appraiser Independence Requirements,
Property Data Collector Independence Requirements,
private transfer fee requirements, and
Ability to Repay Loan Eligibility Requirements as set forth in B2-1.5-02, Loan Eligibility.
Examples
Examples of breach of compliance with laws, responsible lending practices requirements, and FHFA directives

include, but are not limited to, the following:
The appraisal for a mortgage loan does not conform to the Appraiser Independence Requirements (FHFA directive)
The property data collection does not conform to the Property Data Collector Independence Requirements (FHFA directive)
A mortgage loan is secured by a unit in a condo project that was not created in compliance with applicable state law. (Compliance with Laws)
A mortgage loan has a borrower that is an inter vivos revocable trust that was not formed in accordance with applicable law. (Compliance with Laws)
A Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan was not originated in accordance with Texas law. (Compliance with Laws)
A lender charged total points and fees for an ATR Covered loan in excess of the applicable limit on such points and fees in Regulation Z, 12 CFR § 1026.43(e)(3). (Compliance with Laws)
A HOEPA loan. (Responsible Lending Practices)
Note: Whether any loan is subject to repurchase for noncompliance with laws will depend on whether the conditions for repurchase in A3-2-01, Compliance With Laws, are satisﬁed. Loans that are not subject to repurchase under A3-2-01 may be subject to other remedies. Loans that violate Fannie Mae’s Responsible Lending Practices or an FHFA directive are subject to repurchase.
Life-of-Loan Exclusions: Unacceptable Mortgage Products
Certain mortgage loan products are not purchased by Fannie Mae. As such, these products are not eligible for the enforcement relief described in A2-3.2-02, Enforcement Relief for Breaches of Certain Representations and Warranties Related to Underwriting and Eligibility. Note that the list below is not intended to be exhaustive; it should be used as a reference tool in conjunction with the requirements of the Selling Guide.
Examples of loan products that Fannie Mae does not purchase are
mortgages with an interest-only feature;
graduated-payment mortgages, including growing-equity mortgages;
mortgages originated with stated or no income and/or asset documentation (high LTV reﬁnances are not covered by this provision);
mortgages subject to negative amortization;
construction mortgages (other than construction-to-permanent);
daily simple interest mortgages;
mortgages with prepayment penalties;
reverse mortgages;
mortgages with balloon payments (with or without a reset option); and

Chapter A2-3, Lender Breach of Contract
Introduction
This chapter addresses the remedies available to Fannie Mae when a lender breaches the Lender Contract.
Section A2-3.1, Lender Breach of Contract
A2-3.1-01, Lender Breach of Contract (08/05/2020)
Introduction This topic contains information on the lender’s breach of its Lender Contract, including:
Lender Breach of Contract Alternatives to Contract Termination
Lender Breach of Contract
Fannie Mae may terminate the Lender Contract (in its entirety or its individual selling arrangement or servicing arrangement) with cause at any time and immediately, if the lender breaches any provisions of its Lender Contract, including (among other things) a failure to follow the requirements of Fannie Mae’s Guides, to meet Fannie Mae’s net worth and other ﬁnancial requirements, or to meet any of the other eligibility requirements speciﬁed in the Lender Contract. A lender also breaches the Lender Contract in the event of a change in the lender’s ﬁnancial or business condition, or in its operations, which in Fannie Mae’s sole judgment, is material and adverse. It is within Fannie Mae’s discretion to determine whether a particular occurrence—or the
Published February 5, 2025
38
aggregate eﬀect of multiple occurrences—warrants termination of the entire Lender Contract or a speciﬁc arrangement.
Fannie Mae’s decision to terminate a lender’s selling arrangement, servicing arrangement, or the entire Lender Contract does not entitle the lender to recover any exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages. Fannie Mae will not pay a termination fee in such cases and it may make the termination eﬀective immediately. Fannie Mae may oﬀset any obligations that it may owe the lender against any obligations the lender may owe Fannie Mae under any existing agreement, whether or not Fannie Mae has made any demand under such agreement and even though such obligations may not yet be immediately due. If Fannie Mae’s decision to terminate is based on the lender’s breach of the Lender Contract related to its selling arrangement, Fannie Mae may declare the lender’s outstanding cash commitments and MBS pool purchase contracts to be void—and Fannie Mae has the right to terminate the entire Lender Contract (including the lender’s servicing arrangement) for cause.
When Fannie Mae terminates a lender’s servicing arrangement for cause based on the lender’s breach of its Lender Contract related to its servicing arrangement or in connection with the termination of the entire Lender Contract, the lender will have no further rights in the servicing of the mortgages it had been servicing for Fannie Mae.
Alternatives to Contract Termination
The Lender Contract provides remedies to Fannie Mae for the lender’s nonperformance. Any remedies that are applied will, in Fannie Mae’s sole judgment, be commensurate with the associated level of risk.
Generally, Fannie Mae pursues these remedies when it believes that the lender should have an opportunity to correct the breach of the Lender Contract.
Instead of terminating all or a part of the Lender Contract (or the lender’s selling arrangement or servicing arrangement) when it has cause to do so, Fannie Mae may elect to pursue a variety of other remedies and/or may impose additional requirements as a condition for not terminating all or a part of the Lender Contract (or the lender's selling arrangement or servicing arrangement). The following list provides some possible requirements that Fannie Mae may impose as a condition for not undertaking remedies to which it is entitled by virtue of a lender’s breach:
requiring the lender to indemnify Fannie Mae for actual and prospective Fannie Mae losses;
requiring the lender to repurchase a mortgage loan or an acquired property or remit a make whole payment;
imposing a compensatory fee;
imposing a suspension or some other formal sanction against the lender;
requiring additional and more frequent ﬁnancial and operational reporting;
accelerating the processing and rebuttal time periods and payment of outstanding repurchases and repurchase/indemniﬁcation obligations;
requiring the lender to take steps to sell and transfer all of its Fannie Mae servicing, or portions thereof as designated by Fannie Mae, to an unrelated entity upon 90 days' written notice from Fannie Mae;
limiting the lender from acquiring additional Fannie Mae servicing (over and above its existing servicing) in either its servicing or its subservicing portfolio;
Published February 5, 2025
39
modifying or suspending any contract or agreement with a lender, including termination, suspension, or rescission of any variance approved under the terms thereof;
requiring the lender to post collateral in the form of cash or cash equivalents reasonably acceptable to Fannie Mae in an amount determined by Fannie Mae based on the particular circumstances;
imposing limitations on early funding products or recourse transactions;
imposing limits on trading desk transactions; or
requiring advance payment of fees for technology services.
Fannie Mae is willing to work with lenders and consider other solutions that can correct or adequately address the concerns of Fannie Mae.
Fannie Mae has no obligation to pursue any of these alternatives, and its decision to pursue one or more of the alternatives does not waive, limit, or aﬀect Fannie Mae’s right to terminate the Lender Contract (or one or more individual arrangements) at any time that Fannie Mae deems it appropriate to do so under the provisions of the Lender Contract. Fannie Mae’s decision not to take action against a lender at any point in time does not mean that Fannie Mae condones any action or inaction by the lender, or that Fannie Mae is waiving its right to take action in the future. Also see the Servicing Guide for information related to termination for cause.

Imposition of Sanctions
Published February 5, 2025

When Fannie Mae determines that a lender’s performance of its selling and/or servicing obligations does not meet the standards in its Lender Contract, Fannie Mae may impose a formal sanction to give the lender oﬃcial notice of its shortcomings and an opportunity to correct its deﬁciencies. Prior to imposing any sanction, Fannie Mae will generally give the lender notice of the contemplated action so the lender can submit a written response or request a meeting with its Fannie Mae customer account team. The lender’s written response must include a description and explanation of any mitigating circumstances or speciﬁc proposals to satisfy Fannie Mae’s objections to the lender’s performance of its obligations under the Lender Contract. Fannie Mae reserves the right to omit these steps and take immediate action to terminate or suspend the Lender Contract at any time in accordance with the provisions thereof.
If any act, omission, or failure of performance by a lender constitutes a breach of the Lender Contract, Fannie Mae is not obligated to impose a sanction prior to exercising its contractual right to terminate or suspend the lender’s selling arrangement, servicing arrangement, or all of its Lender Contract. If Fannie Mae initially chooses to place a lender under a formal sanction, Fannie Mae can subsequently decide that termination or suspension is the more appropriate action and take immediate steps to eﬀect the termination even if the terms of the sanction have not yet expired.
Suspension of Selling Arrangement
Fannie Mae may suspend a Lender Contract for a speciﬁed period of time or it may state that the suspension is for an “indeﬁnite period.” Fannie Mae usually speciﬁes an “indeﬁnite period” when Fannie Mae wants the lender to satisfy certain conditions—such as the hiring of additional staﬀ—before Fannie Mae removes the suspension. Fannie Mae may apply the suspension of a selling arrangement to all products or to speciﬁc products, depending on the type and seriousness of the lender’s failure to perform. Even when Fannie Mae suspends a lender’s selling arrangement, it will honor any outstanding whole loan commitments and MBS pool purchase contracts. However, if Fannie Mae decides to terminate the lender’s selling arrangement (or the entire Lender Contract) for cause either at or before the end of the suspension period, it may declare any outstanding pricing or purchase commitments or pool purchase contracts to be void.
Fannie Mae may suspend the Lender Contract whenever a breach has been identiﬁed. Fannie Mae may suspend a lender's right to add new mortgage loans to its Fannie Mae servicing portfolio—whether those mortgage loans represent new mortgage loans Fannie Mae would purchase or securitize or existing Fannie Mae-owned or Fannie Mae-securitized mortgage loans that would be transferred from another servicer. The suspension of new servicing may apply to all types of mortgage loans or to speciﬁc products, depending on the nature of the lender's performance deﬁciencies.
Termination
Fannie Mae may terminate the Lender Contract, including selling and servicing, with or without cause, in accordance with Section IX of the MSSC.
Termination Without Cause
Fannie Mae may terminate a lender’s selling arrangement at any time without cause—eﬀective immediately—by providing the lender with written notice of Fannie Mae’s intent to do so.
Published February 5, 2025
41
A lender may terminate its selling arrangement at any time—and eﬀective immediately—by giving Fannie Mae written notice of its intent to do so. Any responsibilities or liabilities related to speciﬁc mortgages or MBS pools that the lender had before the termination will continue to exist after the termination unless Fannie Mae expressly agrees in writing to release the lender from those responsibilities and liabilities. The lender shall be responsible for all reasonable and customary costs and expenses related to the transfer of servicing in connection with a lender's voluntary termination of its servicing rights.
Termination of the lender’s selling arrangement does not aﬀect any obligations in connection with any pricing or purchase commitments or pool purchase contracts that the lender has outstanding with Fannie Mae at the time of the termination; provided however that Fannie Mae may declare any outstanding pricing or purchase commitments or pool purchase contracts to be void.
Termination also does not release the lender from its responsibilities or liabilities related to mortgage loans and MBS pools that Fannie Mae purchased, securitized, or contracted to purchase or securitize before the termination, including the obligation to repurchase a mortgage loan in connection with the breach of a selling warranty, even if the breach is not discovered until after the termination, the breach did not result in any Fannie Mae losses, or the selling warranty was assumed in connection with an earlier transfer of servicing to another lender.
Additional provisions related to termination of servicing are described in the Servicing Guide.
Termination With Cause
If Fannie Mae terminates the lender’s selling arrangement with cause, it will be eﬀective immediately and Fannie Mae may declare any outstanding pricing or purchase commitments or pool purchase contracts to be void. Additional provisions related to termination of servicing are set forth in the Servicing Guide.

Introduction This topic contains information on loan repurchases and make whole payments requested by Fannie Mae, including:
Overview Violation of Contractual Warranty Conditions Requiring Repurchase Lender Response to a Demand Repurchase Resolution Payment of Repurchase Proceeds Redelivery of Repurchased Loans Repurchase Price
Overview
As part of its quality control (QC) system, Fannie Mae reviews mortgage loans that it has purchased or securitized. Fannie Mae may conduct several diﬀerent types of reviews, including post-purchase reviews, early payment default reviews, servicing reviews, and post-foreclosure reviews. During the QC reviews, Fannie Mae may identify a “defect”—a loan-level deﬁciency that breaches a term contained in the Lender Contract in eﬀect at the time of loan delivery. These reviews may result in loan repurchase demands, make whole payment demands, or other alternative remedies.
Fannie Mae requires some repurchases because the terms under which the mortgages were purchased or securitized call for a repurchase under certain conditions or circumstances. Repurchases that fall into this category generally include, but are not limited to, Charter violations, an adjustable-rate mortgage in an MBS pool that has converted to a ﬁxed-rate mortgage per the borrower’s exercise of its option in the mortgage documents, or an MBS mortgage that has 24 payments past due.
Certain mortgage loans may be eligible for relief from enforcement for breaches of certain representations and warranties once the mortgage loan has satisﬁed the requirements described in A2-3.2-02, Enforcement Relief for Breaches of Certain Representations and Warranties Related to Underwriting and Eligibility. Eligible mortgage loans include those loans acquired by Fannie Mae on or after January 1, 2013.
Violation of Contractual Warranty
If Fannie Mae's loan review determines (or Fannie Mae otherwise learns) that a mortgage loan did not meet Fannie Mae requirements due to violation of the Lender Contract or, if the “remedies framework” applies and a “signiﬁcant defect” is identiﬁed, Fannie Mae may require the lender to immediately repurchase the mortgage loan or acquired property (or Fannie Mae's participation interest in the mortgage loan) or to remit a make whole payment if the property has been liquidated.
Fannie Mae may also require repurchase or a make whole payment if any warranty the selling lender made is untrue and, if the remedies framework applies, qualiﬁes as a signiﬁcant defect, whether or not the lender had
Published February 5, 2025
43
actual knowledge of the untruth. No such repurchase (or make whole payment) request will be made if the warranty speciﬁcally states that a violation does not exist unless the lender had actual knowledge of the untruth and the lender has no such knowledge.
A quality control loan ﬁle review or payment of loan-level price adjustments in no way limits Fannie Mae’s right to require a repurchase or a make whole payment if a warranty breach is later discovered, unless the mortgage loan has qualiﬁed for relief under the enforcement relief framework and the subsequent breach is not a breach of a life-of-loan warranty or any other warranty outside of Subparts B1 to B5 of the Selling Guide.
Note: For additional information, including deﬁnitions, see D2-1-03, Outcomes of Fannie Mae QC Reviews, and D2-1-04, Identifying and Remedying Origination Defects Under the Remedies Framework.
Conditions Requiring Repurchase
Fannie Mae has the right to require a lender to repurchase a mortgage loan or an acquired property, or remit a make whole payment, as a result of a breach of the Lender Contract. For loans subject to the remedies framework, if a breach of a selling representation and warranty is identiﬁed, such breach must result in a signiﬁcant defect. In addition to repurchase for breach of warranty, lenders may be required to repurchase some loans because the terms under which the mortgage loans were purchased or securitized call for a repurchase. Unless a loan has qualiﬁed for relief from enforcement for breaches of certain selling representations and warranties in accordance with A2-3.2-02, Enforcement Relief for Breaches of Certain Representations and Warranties Related to Underwriting and Eligibility, a decision not to require repurchase at a particular time does not waive Fannie Mae's right to demand repurchase at a later time, or to institute other remedies for breach of the Lender Contract.
Fannie Mae may conduct several diﬀerent types of reviews with respect to a mortgage loan, including a post- purchase review, an early payment default review, a servicing review, or a post-foreclosure review. During the course of a review, Fannie Mae may identify
signiﬁcant underwriting deﬁciencies,
signiﬁcant defects,
a breach of a selling representation or warranty, or
a breach of the terms of any applicable contract provision.
If any of the foregoing are identiﬁed, Fannie Mae may require the immediate repurchase of a mortgage loan or an acquired property or the remittance of a make whole payment (all of which fall under the deﬁnition of a “demand”) unless and until such mortgage loan is eligible for relief from enforcement for breaches of certain underwriting and eligibility representations and warranties in accordance with A2-3.2-02, Enforcement Relief for Breaches of Certain Representations and Warranties Related to Underwriting and Eligibility.
In some instances, Fannie Mae may enter into other repurchase alternatives. See A2-3.2-03, Remedies Framework, and the Servicing Guide.
In some instances in which the lender has breached its representations or warranties, Fannie Mae may allow the lender to correct the warranty violation. During the appeal and impasse processes, the lender has the right to correct a signiﬁcant defect for mortgage loans subject to the remedies framework in the time frame and manner required by the Lender Contract. If no time frame or manner for correction is identiﬁed in the Lender Contract,
Published February 5, 2025
44
the correction of the signiﬁcant defect shall be as determined by Fannie Mae. See Subpart D2, Fannie Mae QC Process, for additional information about the quality control selection and review process and timelines related to the remedies framework.
Lender Response to a Demand
When Fannie Mae requires a repurchase or a make whole payment because of a breach, the lender should work with the Fannie Mae individual or department noted on the demand to resolve any issues. Fannie Mae has an established appeal, impasse, management escalation, and Independent Dispute Resolution process (see A2-3.2-03, Remedies Framework).
Despite the best eﬀorts of both parties, Fannie Mae and the lender may not always be able to reach a mutual agreement. In such cases, the lender must repurchase the mortgage loan, the acquired property, or Fannie Mae’s participation interest in the mortgage loan or the acquired property or exercise its rights under the appeal, impasse, and management escalation process, or the Independent Dispute Resolution process.
Repurchase Resolution
When Fannie Mae identiﬁes a defective mortgage, it may, in its sole discretion, impose a condition to retaining the loan, such as requiring the lender to agree to an alternative remedy to repurchase. In some cases, as permitted in the Lender Contract, Fannie Mae will issue a repurchase or make whole payment demand to the lender. The selling defects that give rise to a repurchase or make whole payment demand for loans covered by the remedies framework consist of errors or failures that Fannie Mae identiﬁes as signiﬁcant defects, as described in D2-1-03, Outcomes of Fannie Mae QC Reviews.
This Guide contains timelines by which lenders must pay Fannie Mae the funds that are due in connection with a repurchase or make whole payment demand or other alternative remedy. If a lender delays in this or has a pattern of unresponsiveness, Fannie Mae may consider this a breach of contract and consider other actions against the lender, up to and including termination.
For performing mortgage loans with signiﬁcant defects covered by the remedies framework, Fannie Mae may elect not to require immediate repurchase, but may instead oﬀer a repurchase alternative. The nature and severity of the ﬁndings, ﬁnancial and operational strength of the lender, the quality of the mortgages sold, servicing performance, the acceptability of the investment, and the loan payment history are some of the criteria that may be used by Fannie Mae in deciding whether to use this option. Fannie Mae may consider a lender’s counterparty status in determining whether a loan is retainable and to the extent that there are future obligations required as part of the repurchase alternative.
Payment of Repurchase Proceeds
For mortgage loans acquired by Fannie Mae prior to January 1, 2013, the lender must pay Fannie Mae the funds that are due in connection with a repurchase or make whole payment demand within 30 days (or with its next scheduled remittance following the completion of the 30–day period).
For mortgage loans with acquisition dates on or after January 1, 2013, the lender must pay Fannie Mae the funds that are due in connection with a demand for repurchase, indemniﬁcation, or make whole payment within
Published February 5, 2025
45
60 days after receipt of the demand or within such other time frame as speciﬁed by Fannie Mae unless an appeal is made. (For repurchase demands made on a loan that has not been foreclosed upon or liquidated, the payment of the repurchase price may be made by the lender (or servicer) with its next scheduled remittance following the completion of the 60–day period.) If a lender delays in this, or has a pattern of unresponsiveness, Fannie Mae may consider this a breach of contract and consider other actions against the lender, up to and including termination.
Should Fannie Mae have to take legal action to enforce its right to require repurchase of a mortgage (or property), the lender will also be liable for Fannie Mae’s attorney’s fees, costs, and related expenses, as well as for any applicable consequential damages.
Note: Lender or servicer responsibilities described herein may actually be those of the “responsible party,” as applicable.
Redelivery of Repurchased Loans
If a mortgage loan was repurchased by a lender, and the repurchased loan is subsequently made compliant with Fannie Mae's current standards, the loan may be redelivered to Fannie Mae, at its sole and absolute discretion, on a negotiated basis.
The lender represents and warrants that the mortgage being delivered is not a mortgage that was required to be repurchased by a secondary market investor, government-sponsored enterprise, or private institutional investor other than Fannie Mae for any documentation, underwriting, property valuation, deﬁciencies and/or issues with the property (including project eligibility if the property is in a condo, co-op, or PUD project), borrower credit, or other deﬁciencies or for any other reason. These types of mortgages are not eligible for delivery even if the identiﬁed defect has been corrected by the lender.
Note: A mortgage loan that a lender repurchased from another investor or GSE that was delivered in error to that investor or GSE is eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae as long as it meets all requirements of the Selling Guide.
In the event that a mortgage loan is deemed ineligible for redelivery to Fannie Mae or rejected by Fannie Mae upon redelivery, any future losses incurred after repurchase are the responsibility of the lender and not Fannie Mae.
Repurchase Price
Whenever Fannie Mae requires repurchase of a mortgage loan without redelivery to Fannie Mae’s portfolio and, at the time of the repurchase, title to the security property has passed to Fannie Mae (or is held for Fannie Mae, but in the name of the servicer pursuant to its duties as Fannie Mae's servicer), Fannie Mae will require repurchase of Fannie Mae’s interest in the property, or for the lender to remit a make whole payment if the property has been liquidated.
The repurchase price for a mortgage loan and the purchase price for an acquired property will be the same as if the lender were repurchasing the mortgage loan with accrued interest and other adjustments, including Fannie Mae’s property-related expenses such as maintenance and marketing expenses, through the date of repurchase. Loan-level price adjustments (LLPAs) will not be included in the repurchase price or make whole payment calculation; however, lenders may be eligible for a partial LLPA refund on certain loans that have been
Published February 5, 2025
46
repurchased. See C1-1-01, Execution Options, for additional information.
The purchase price is not based on the market value of the property at the time of the purchase but on all amounts due Fannie Mae on the subject mortgage loan and property. When the servicer purchases the property or remits a make whole payment, Fannie Mae also will convey all rights as owner of the loan (e.g., deﬁciency rights), if any, that Fannie Mae may still have pursuant to applicable state law, but Fannie Mae has no obligation to the servicer or responsible party to have preserved such rights. If the property has been liquidated, Fannie Mae will issue a demand for a make whole payment to compensate it for the losses it suﬀered in purchasing a defective mortgage.

A2-3.2-02, Enforcement Relief for Breaches of Certain
Representations and Warranties Related to Underwriting and
Eligibility (08/04/2021)
Introduction This topic describes the framework that provides lenders with relief from Fannie Mae's enforcement for breaches of certain underwriting and eligibility representations and warranties for loans that meet speciﬁc payment history or other eligibility requirements. This topic contains information on the following subjects:
Overview of the Enforcement Relief Framework Scope of Enforcement Relief of Underwriting and Eligibility Representations and Warranties Loans Eligible for Enforcement Relief Additional Eligibility Criteria for Enforcement Relief Notiﬁcation of Relief Life-of-Loan Representation and Warranty Exclusions
Overview of the Enforcement Relief Framework
Representations and warranties required by Fannie Mae are described in the Mortgage Selling and Servicing Contract, the Selling and Servicing Guides, and other Lender Contracts. Violation of any representation and warranty is a breach of the Lender Contract, entitling Fannie Mae to pursue certain remedies, including a loan repurchase or make whole payment demand as more fully described in A2-3.2-01, Loan Repurchases and Make Whole Payments Requested by Fannie Mae. For conventional loans that are acquired by Fannie Mae on a ﬂow basis, the lender will be relieved of its obligation to remedy breaches of certain underwriting and eligibility representations and warranties if the loan meets certain eligibility criteria described under Loans Eligible for Enforcement Relief below. This framework does not change the underlying representations and warranties the lender makes to Fannie Mae when selling loans; it changes whether and how Fannie Mae will enforce breaches
Published February 5, 2025
47
of those representations after a loan has achieved relief under the framework. No relief will be available for breaches of certain “life-of-loan” representations and warranties as described in Life-of-Loan Representation and Warranty Exclusions below, regardless of whether a loan otherwise qualiﬁes for relief. The availability of the enforcement relief framework does not discharge lenders from the responsibility for underwriting and delivering quality loans in accordance with Fannie Mae's requirements.
Note: Certain components of the loan may qualify for individual enforcement relief outside of this framework. For example, a loan may qualify for enforcement relief on the borrower’s income at the time the loan is sold to Fannie Mae, and later obtain enforcement relief based on payment history. Life-of-loan exclusions will apply at all times. See A2-2-04, Limited Waiver and Enforcement Relief of Representations and Warranties, for additional information.
Scope of Enforcement Relief of Underwriting and Eligibility Representations and Warranties
With respect to an eligible loan (as deﬁned below), a lender will be relieved of the requirement to remedy a loan (such as repurchase, a make whole payment, or other repurchase alternative as more fully described in A2-3.2-03, Remedies Framework) if that loan violates Fannie Mae's single-family underwriting and eligibility requirements described in the applicable parts of the Selling Guide and other Lender Contracts relating to:
underwriting the borrower, which includes the lender's assessment of the borrower's loan terms, credit history, employment and income, assets, and other ﬁnancial information used for qualifying the borrower for the loan;
underwriting the subject property, which includes the lender's analysis of the description and valuation of the property to determine its adequacy as collateral for the mortgage transaction; and
underwriting the project in which the property is located, which includes the lender's analysis of the condo, co-op, or PUD project in accordance with Fannie Mae's requirements.
The following subparts of the Selling Guide are covered by the relief:
Subpart B1, Loan Application Package;
Subpart B2, Eligibility;
Subpart B3, Underwriting Borrowers;
Subpart B4, Underwriting Property; and
Subpart B5, Unique Eligibility and Underwriting Considerations.
Note: If a loan with a breach or alleged breach has achieved enforcement relief as provided in this topic, then the obligation to indemnify Fannie Mae is limited in certain respects. See A2-1-03, Indemniﬁcation for Losses, for a description of the continuing indemniﬁcation obligations.
Loans Eligible for Enforcement Relief
Published February 5, 2025
48
To be eligible for the representation and warranty enforcement relief, a loan must meet the acquisition date, payment history, Fannie Mae quality control (QC) review requirements, and additional eligibility requirements, each as described below.
Loans must have been acquired by Fannie Mae as either:
whole loans purchased on or after July 1, 2014; or
mortgage loans delivered into MBS with pool issue dates on or after July 1, 2014.
Payment History Requirements
For all loans other than Fannie Mae high LTV reﬁnance loans: To be eligible for relief under the framework, if the relief is based on the borrower’s acceptable payment history, the relief will occur
upon payment by the borrower of the ﬁrst 36 monthly payments due following the loan acquisition date, provided that the borrower
had no more than two 30-day delinquencies,
had no 60-day or greater delinquencies, and
is not 30 or more days delinquent with respect to the 36th monthly payment.
For Fannie Mae high LTV reﬁnance loans: Relief is based on the earlier of
payment by the borrower of the ﬁrst 12 monthly payments due following the loan acquisition date, provided the borrower had no 30–day or greater delinquencies; or
payment by the borrower of the ﬁrst 36 monthly payments due following the loan acquisition date, provided the borrower
had no more than two 30-day delinquencies,
had no 60-day or greater delinquencies, and
is not 30 or more days delinquent with respect to the 36th monthly payment.
Fannie Mae Full-File QC Review
Under the framework, there is an alternative path through which loans may qualify for relief of the selling representations and warranties based on the satisfactory conclusion of a full-ﬁle QC review. This enforcement relief will occur when one of the following takes place:
Fannie Mae completes a full-ﬁle QC review of the loan ﬁle, which includes a review of the credit underwriting and eligibility of the borrower, the property (including its value), and the project in which the property is located, if applicable, and determines that the loan is acceptable (that is, it is not subject to a repurchase demand).
Fannie Mae completes the full-ﬁle QC review of the loan ﬁle and determines the loan is not acceptable because of a selling deﬁciency that the Selling or Servicing Guide speciﬁcally identiﬁes may be corrected. If the lender corrects such deﬁciency in the time frame and manner speciﬁed in the Lender Contract, relief will be eﬀective upon the satisfactory correction of the deﬁciency as determined by Fannie Mae through a reassessment of the loan.
Published February 5, 2025
49
For example, if the loan ﬁle delivered to Fannie Mae did not contain the required veriﬁcation of income, the defect would be deemed to be corrected if the lender provided the missing documentation requested by Fannie Mae within the time frame speciﬁed. Another example of an action taken to correct a deﬁciency is rectifying a prior mortgage lien by producing evidence of a recorded satisfaction or release of such prior mortgage lien within the time frame speciﬁed.
Fannie Mae completes the full-ﬁle QC review of the loan ﬁle and determines the loan is not acceptable but may be eligible for a repurchase alternative which expires or terminates by its terms. In this case, relief will be eﬀective upon the satisfactory expiration or termination of the alternative to repurchase.
For example, if Fannie Mae determined a loan was not acceptable and, as an alternative to repurchase, Fannie Mae and the lender agreed that the loan would be subject to credit enhancement for 5 years, the loan would be relieved of the selling representations and warranties at the end of the 5-year period. Other possible alternatives to repurchase include recourse, make- whole arrangements, and certain split loss agreements; in each case, the repurchase alternative must satisfactorily expire or terminate by its terms in order for the aﬀected loan to be eligible for relief from the selling representations and warranties under the framework.
Note: The requirements for obtaining relief based on a full-ﬁle QC review apply both to performing loans and non-performing loans. As a result, lenders may obtain relief through the QC path regardless of whether the loan had an acceptable payment history.
Post-Relief Loan File and Appraisal Reviews. Fannie Mae may perform loan ﬁle reviews for quality assurance and audit purposes both before and after a loan obtains enforcement relief under the framework. However, Fannie Mae cannot issue a repurchase demand or seek an alternative remedy with respect to a deﬁciency in the underwriting of the borrower, the property, or the project that is relieved under the framework (such as a deﬁciency related to the LTV ratio or debt-to-income ratio) when that deﬁciency is discovered after the loan has obtained enforcement relief unless the deﬁciency qualiﬁes as breach of a “life-of-loan” representation and warranty. A repurchase demand or alternative remedy may be issued only when the deﬁciency involves one of the life-of-loan exclusions or another provision of the Selling Guide that is not relieved under the framework.
Note: If, after a loan has obtained relief under the framework, Fannie Mae reviews an appraisal and determines that the property value used to calculate the LTV ratio was incorrect at the time of delivery, Fannie Mae will not issue a repurchase demand based solely on the fact that the newly calculated LTV ratio is over 80% and the loan did not have credit enhancement in place when it was delivered to Fannie Mae.
Additional Eligibility Criteria for Enforcement Relief
In addition to the acquisition date, payment history, or QC requirements described above, the following criteria must also be met for loans to qualify for relief:
The loan must be a conventional loan sold to Fannie Mae on a ﬂow basis.
Government-guaranteed or -insured loans are not eligible for enforcement relief.
Non-ﬂow seasoned or loans sold in bulk may be eligible for enforcement relief only on a negotiated basis. (Seasoned loans that are sold to Fannie Mae on a ﬂow basis in accordance with the Selling Guide are
Published February 5, 2025
50
eligible for enforcement relief.)
The determination of whether the loan has an acceptable payment history begins on the date of the ﬁrst monthly mortgage payment due after the Fannie Mae acquisition date.
With the exception of loans with temporary buydowns, neither the lender nor a third party with a ﬁnancial interest in the performance of the loan (such as a mortgage broker, correspondent lender, or mortgage insurer) can escrow or advance funds on behalf of the borrower to be used for payment of any principal or interest payable under the terms of the loan for the purpose of satisfying the payment history requirement.
The loan cannot have been sold to Fannie Mae with any credit enhancement other than traditional primary mortgage insurance (i.e., lender- or borrower-paid mortgage insurance).
Loans with credit enhancement other than traditional primary mortgage insurance may be eligible for enforcement relief only on a negotiated basis.
Loans not impacted by a disaster that become subject to a forbearance agreement are eligible for relief based on the borrower’s payment history; or, on the basis of a QC review of the loan ﬁle if the loan meets all other requirements. Loans that become subject to a repayment plan, or are otherwise modiﬁed from the original terms after acquisition by Fannie Mae are not eligible for relief based on the borrower’s payment history, but may be eligible on the basis of a QC review of the loan ﬁle if the loan otherwise meets all other requirements.
Loans that become subject to a disaster-related forbearance agreement and any subsequent repayment plan or modiﬁcation, are eligible for relief based on the borrower’s payment history or on the basis of a QC review of the loan ﬁle if the loan otherwise meets all other requirements. See the disaster-related forbearance criteria below for additional requirements.
With the exception of certain loans purchased under the terms of a long-term standby purchase commitment (LTSC), the loans cannot have had any delinquencies between the origination date and the Fannie Mae acquisition date.
For loans classiﬁed as “Class 1 Mortgage Loans” or “Class 4 Mortgage Loans” that are purchased under an LTSC, the payment history requirement will be measured from the date the loan was committed under the LTSC structure (the 12–, 36–, or 60–month time frame will begin on the date the loan was committed into the LTSC).
The loan must not be subject to an outstanding request for repurchase, repurchase alternative, or make whole payment. (See A2-3.2-03, Remedies Framework, for additional information.)
Note: Unless otherwise agreed to by Fannie Mae and the lender, once a loan has qualiﬁed for the representation and warranty enforcement relief by compliance with the requirements above, eligibility for the enforcement relief is ﬁnal and irrevocable subject to the life-of-loan representation and warranty exclusions.
Additional Eligibility Criteria for Loans Subject to Disaster-Related Forbearance
To be eligible for relief, the following applies:
The loan is impacted by a disaster occurring on or after August 25, 2017.
The property or borrower’s place of employment is located in any county, city, or parish that is a designated FEMA-Declared Disaster Area eligible for Individual Assistance as result of a natural disaster.
the loan will be eligible for relief based on payment history on the later of
Published February 5, 2025
51
the applicable payment history period end date as required under the framework; or
the date the loan transitions out of disaster-related forbearance and is brought current via a reinstatement, repayment plan, or permanent modiﬁcation.
the loan must be brought current through a lump sum payment or a repayment plan completed as agreed. If the forbearance plan transitioned to a permanent modiﬁcation, the borrower must have completed the trial period plan and executed a permanent modiﬁcation agreement for any of the modiﬁcation options available through the Fannie Mae Servicing Guide.
The period of time the loan is in forbearance “counts” toward the payment history requirement and the months in forbearance are not considered delinquent within the relief framework. For example, if the forbearance
occurred during months 30-32, the loan may still be eligible for enforcement relief on or after the 36th month of payment history as long as all other payments outside the forbearance met the requirements.
Notiﬁcation of Relief
Fannie Mae will provide lenders with reports listing those loans that met the eligibility requirements for relief.
Life-of-Loan Representation and Warranty Exclusions
A lender is not relieved from the enforcement of breaches of its representations and warranties on any loan, including eligible loans, with respect to the following matters even if those matters are addressed in Subparts B1 through B5 of the Selling Guide. With respect to each loan, a lender remains responsible for the life-of-loan representations and warranties related to the following, as more fully described in A2-2-07, Life-of-Loan Representations and Warranties :
Fannie Mae Charter Act Matters;
Misstatements, Misrepresentations, and Omissions;
Data Inaccuracies;
Clear Title/First-Lien Enforceability;
Compliance with Laws and Responsible Lending Practices; and
Acceptable Mortgage Products.

Introduction This topic contains additional information pertaining to the remedies framework, including:
The Remedies Framework Alternatives to Mortgage Loan Repurchases Conditions to Mortgage Loan Repurchase Alternatives Appeal Process Impasse and Management Escalation Processes Independent Dispute Resolution (IDR) Process
The Remedies Framework
The origination defect and remedies framework (“the remedies framework”) expands upon certain provisions related to the representation and warranties framework. The remedies framework relates speciﬁcally to the categorization of defects, lender corrections of those defects, and available remedies when defects are identiﬁed, including alternatives to repurchase.
The remedies framework applies to whole loans purchased, and mortgage loans delivered into MBS with pool issue dates on or after January 1, 2016. See D2-1-03, Outcomes of Fannie Mae QC Reviews, and D2-1-04, Identifying and Remedying Origination Defects Under the Remedies Framework, for additional information about the remedies framework.
Alternatives to Mortgage Loan Repurchases
In certain circumstances, Fannie Mae may provide the lender with an alternative to the immediate repurchase of a mortgage loan that does not meet Fannie Mae's requirements.
For loans subject to the remedies framework, Fannie Mae may consider a loan with a signiﬁcant defect for a repurchase alternative depending on Fannie Mae’s commercially reasonable determination that the loan is retainable. Fannie Mae will determine whether the loan is retainable based on the lender’s counterparty status and whether the loan was an acceptable investment at the time of purchase. In this context, the lender’s counterparty status is Fannie Mae’s assessment of the lender’s ﬁnancial capacity, which could determine which remedy Fannie Mae will oﬀer to the lender.
Published February 5, 2025
53
For any loan oﬀered a repurchase alternative, Fannie Mae will notify the lender in writing of the type and terms of the repurchase alternative. The alternatives may include, but are not limited to, any one or more of the following, as determined by Fannie Mae in its discretion.
Repurchase Alternatives for Performing Loans
Repurchase Alternatives for Non-performing Loans
Pricing adjustment—the assessment by Fannie
Mae and payment by the lender of a guaranty fee
adjustment, risk fee, or additional loan-level price
adjustment with respect to the mortgage.
Recourse—an agreement by the lender to provide
recourse for the life of the loan or for some other
speciﬁed period of time.
Collateralized recourse—recourse as described
above, with respect to which the lender's obligation
is secured by a speciﬁed collateral account.
Indemniﬁcation—an agreement by the lender to
indemnify, defend, and hold Fannie Mae harmless
from any losses incurred by Fannie Mae relating to
the mortgage.
Collateralized indemniﬁcation—indemniﬁcation as
described above, with respect to which the lender's
obligation is secured by a speciﬁed collateral
account.
Collateralized or uncollateralized mortgage
Make-whole payment—the amount that a party
responsible for a breach of a selling representation
or warranty or a servicing breach must pay Fannie
Mae so that Fannie Mae does not incur a loss on
the mortgage or the property.
Split loss or loss share—an agreement between
Fannie Mae and the lender to each pay a speciﬁed
proportion of the losses that have arisen or may
arise in the future relating to the mortgage.
Loss reimbursement—an agreement by the
lender to reimburse Fannie Mae for speciﬁed
losses relating to the mortgage.
insurance stand-in agreement—for certain loans
acquired by Fannie Mae on or after July 1, 2014, the
payment by the lender to Fannie Mae for the full
mortgage insurance beneﬁt amount that would
have been payable under the original rescinded
mortgage insurance policy if the loan liquidates.
Note: If Fannie Mae oﬀers a repurchase alternative after a demand has been issued, the lender has the option to immediately repurchase the loan instead of accepting the repurchase alternative.
Conditions to Mortgage Loan Repurchase Alternatives
Certain repurchase alternatives may be available only to a lender that is in good standing with Fannie Mae, is in a strong ﬁnancial condition acceptable to Fannie Mae, and otherwise satisﬁes Fannie Mae's eligibility criteria. (If the servicing of a mortgage has been transferred to a lender other than the one that sold the mortgage loan to Fannie Mae, eligibility for this beneﬁt will be based on an evaluation of the servicer.)
Published February 5, 2025
54
For loans subject to the remedies framework, Fannie Mae may oﬀer or decline to oﬀer certain repurchase alternatives based on the lender’s counterparty status, to the extent there are future obligations required as part of the repurchase alternative.
Other factors to be considered by Fannie Mae may include, but are not limited to, the failure to maintain a quality loan origination process and the lender’s ability and willingness to comply with other provisions of the Lender Contract. In determining a lender's (or servicer's) eligibility for this repurchase alternative, Fannie Mae will evaluate the following:
the quality of the mortgages the lender sells to (or services for) Fannie Mae, as measured by comparing the delinquency rates for comparable portfolios;
the quality of the servicing performance, as measured by the lender's loss mitigation activities; and
the overall ﬁnancial strength of the lender, as reﬂected in the lender's annual ﬁnancial statements and any other periodic ﬁnancial reports the lender submits to Fannie Mae.
Fannie Mae also will periodically assess the lender's ongoing underwriting performance and contingent repurchase exposure (the lender's repurchase risk exposure in relation to its ﬁnancial ability). When appropriate, Fannie Mae may change the lender's eligibility status for a repurchase alternative.
Note: The MI stand-in repurchase alternative may be available, provided the lender and the mortgage loan meet certain eligibility criteria. Fannie Mae will provide lenders with information on how to initiate a discussion about this repurchase alternative upon notiﬁcation that mortgage insurance has been rescinded and is the only defect identiﬁed.
Appeal Process
A lender may submit a written appeal of a “demand,” which is deﬁned as any request issued by Fannie Mae to a responsible party to provide a speciﬁc remedy as provided in the Lender Contract. (See A2-3.2-01, Loan Repurchases and Make Whole Payments Requested by Fannie Mae, for additional information on loan repurchase and make whole payment demands.)
The “appeal process” includes both the ﬁrst and second appeals available to the responsible party under the conditions described in the following table. The responsible party’s ability to participate in the appeal, impasse, management escalation and Independent Dispute Resolution processes cannot be assigned to another party, such as an insurance company. Note that the responsible party may provide a correction of an alleged signiﬁcant defect at any time during the appeal process.
Detailed information about the requirements for each step in the appeal process may be found in Appeal and Independent Dispute Resolution Processes posted on Fannie Mae’s website, which is incorporated by reference.

Independent Dispute Resolution (IDR) Process
The IDR process is available for disputes that are not resolved through the appeal, impasse, or management escalation processes. The IDR process is available provided the preconditions to each step have been followed and the parties have not ﬁled litigation to attempt to address the dispute. IDR is available to lenders that have not been suspended, disqualiﬁed, or terminated by Fannie Mae, and that have complied with any prior IDR award or demand made by Fannie Mae (as applicable). The IDR process shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et. Seq.
The IDR process addresses loan-level demands and whether alleged breach(es) by the responsible party of its representations and warranties, or duties or responsibilities as provided under the Lender Contract exist at the time IDR commences. The IDR process may be used for
demands relating to a breach of a selling representation, warranty, duty or responsibility, involving whole loans purchased, and mortgage loans delivered into MBS with pool issue dates on and after January 1, 2016; and
demands relating to servicing remedies issued on and after December 1, 2016.
The IDR process cannot be used to resolve the suspension, disqualiﬁcation, or termination of a lender. Nor may the IDR process be used if a lender receives a formal notice of default from Fannie Mae.
A neutral third party, selected by the IDR program administrator, will determine whether the alleged breach(es) existed at the time IDR commenced based on case ﬁle packages and subject matter expert reports submitted in writing by both parties. The neutral party’s decision will be ﬁnal and binding upon the lender and Fannie Mae.
Lender Initiation of IDR. If Fannie Mae reaﬃrms the demand at the end of the management escalation

process, the lender will have 15 days to initiate the IDR by completing and submitting an executed Retainer Agreement located on Fannie Mae’s website to the Fannie Mae oﬃcer involved in the management escalation process and to the program administrator, as described in the Appeal and Independent Dispute Resolution Processes.
If Fannie Mae has not received the lender’s fully completed and executed Retainer Agreement within 15 days of the end of the management escalation period, the lender will have no further right to appeal the existence of the defect in the demand, including the commencement of IDR, and will be obligated to comply with the terms of the demand.
If the lender has not initiated the IDR process by the 15-day deadline or complied with the demand, Fannie Mae shall have the option of either initiating the IDR process within 6 months of the end of the management escalation period or pursuing other remedies.
For additional information about the details of the IDR process, see Appeal and Independent Dispute Resolution Processes posted on Fannie Mae’s website.

Section A2-3.3, Compensatory Fees

Imposition of Compensatory Fees Compensatory Fees for the Late Payment of Commitment, Pair-Oﬀ, or Extension Fees Compensatory Fees for Failure to Comply with Commitment Provisions Compensatory Fees for Failure to Identify Mortgage Loans Subject to Loan-Level Price Adjustments
Imposition of Compensatory Fees
If a lender fails to comply with a speciﬁc requirement for origination, delivery, or servicing of loans, or if Fannie Mae determines that the lender’s overall performance is unsatisfactory, Fannie Mae may impose a fee to compensate Fannie Mae for damages and to emphasize the importance Fannie Mae places on a particular aspect of a lender’s performance. The compensatory fee may relate to the action the lender took, or failed to
Published February 5, 2025
58
take, for a speciﬁc mortgage, or the impact that the lender’s deﬁciencies may have on Fannie Mae. Charging a compensatory fee does not limit Fannie Mae’s right to exercise any other remedy.
See the Servicing Guide for additional information about compensatory fees.
Compensatory Fees for the Late Payment of Commitment, Pair-Oﬀ, or Extension Fees
Fannie Mae may impose a compensatory fee for late payment of commitment, pair-oﬀ, or extension fees. Such fee may be charged when a draft is returned unpaid by Fannie Mae’s ACH agent, or when Fannie Mae receives wire-transferred funds more than ﬁve business days after the date of the commitment or request for the pair-oﬀ or extension.
The compensatory fee is the greater of $50 or a daily interest charge equal to the prime rate plus 3% of the fee that is due. The prime rate will be as published in The Wall Street Journal’s prime rate index (or an equivalent source) in eﬀect on the date the commitment was issued, or the pair-oﬀ or extension took place. Fannie Mae will draft the appropriate compensatory fee—along with the past due commitment, pair-oﬀ, or extension fee—directly from the lender’s designated bank account. (See C2-1.1-02, General Information about Mandatory Commitment Pricing and Fees.)
Compensatory Fees for Failure to Comply with Commitment Provisions
Fannie Mae’s whole loan commitment terms are ﬂexible so that lenders can comply with them under normal circumstances without diﬃculty. For example, to make good delivery on a mandatory commitment, lenders must deliver loans for which the total unpaid principal balance falls within speciﬁc tolerance parameters (for details, see C2-2-01, General Requirements for Good Delivery of Whole Loans).
These ﬂexibilities are provided to account for unusual circumstances beyond the lender’s control that prevent the lender from honoring its contractual obligations. However, Fannie Mae may impose compensatory fees when it has reason to believe that the lender had control over the situation or failed to comply with Fannie Mae requirements in an eﬀort to take advantage of changing market conditions.
Many factors are considered before imposing these compensatory fees; therefore, the exact fee to be charged depends on
the lender’s overall performance,
the lender’s explanation for its noncompliance,
whether the lender has a history of noncompliance, and
the amount of any previous compensatory fee that Fannie Mae imposed.
Compensatory Fees for Failure to Identify Mortgage Loans Subject to Loan-Level Price Adjustments
If a lender consistently fails to identify or incorrectly identiﬁes mortgage loans that are subject to loan-level price adjustments, Fannie Mae may impose a compensatory fee.
Published February 5, 2025

Fannie Mae will take the following factors into consideration:

The seller must establish the individual mortgage loan ﬁle “loan ﬁle” when it originates a loan and clearly identiﬁes each ﬁle with Fannie Mae’s loan number (and Fannie Mae’s participation and participation percentage interest and MBS pool number, if applicable). The loan ﬁle consists of the loan origination ﬁle, the loan custodial ﬁle, and the loan servicing ﬁle held by the seller, servicer, or a prior servicer arising from or related to the origination, sale, securitization, or servicing of a loan or acquired property, as applicable. The loan ﬁle includes all records needed to service the loan and support the validity of the loan, and must be readily accessible in connection with the servicing of the loan.
The loan origination ﬁle consists of the following:
all documents, records and reports used to support the underwriting decision required by the Lender Contract;
any documentation required by Fannie Mae or by law relating to the loan arising from or related to the origination, closing, sale, securitization, or delivery of a loan; and
documents that are required as part of the post-closing mortgage loan ﬁle documentation requirements in the Selling Guide.

Establishing the Loan File for Manufactured Homes
Servicers that have collateral documents for manufactured home loans with application dates prior to August 24, 2003 must retain all such documents, but they are not required to obtain these documents if they do not already have possession of them.
For a manufactured home with an application date on or after August 24, 2003, collateral documents include

documentation (if available) indicating that no certiﬁcate of title (or similar ownership
document) was ever issued in states where a manufactured home can become real property
without ﬁrst being titled as personal property;
documentation evidencing surrender or retirement in states where the certiﬁcate of title (or
similar ownership document) can be surrendered or retired when the home becomes real
property;
the certiﬁcate of title (or similar ownership document) if it has been or cannot be surrendered;
any UCC ﬁnancing statement (or similar notice of lien) that was ﬁled pursuant to applicable law;
and
a security agreement that creates a lien on the manufactured home in addition to the loan or
deed of trust.
In order to be prepared to meet special servicing and default management requirements for loans secured by manufactured homes, the servicer must ensure that all loans secured by manufactured homes are identiﬁed on their internal systems. If it comes to the attention of the servicer that it is servicing a loan secured by a manufactured home that was delivered to Fannie Mae without notation of Special Feature Code 235 (which is required to identify that property type), the servicer must initiate a post-purchase adjustment. See Fannie Mae’s website for additional information.
Additional Information for the Loan File
The seller/servicer must use the loan origination ﬁle to accumulate other pertinent servicing and liquidation information, including, the following:
property inspection reports,
copies of delinquency repayment plans,
copies of disclosures of ARM loan interest rate and payment changes,
documents related to insurance loss settlements, and
foreclosure notices.
The loan custodial ﬁle consists of the custodial documents and all documents, books, records, and reports, in any format, required to be retained by the document custodian pursuant to the Servicing Guide or other Fannie Mae requirements.

The loan servicing ﬁle (including the ﬁle maintained with respect to an acquired property) consists of all documents, books, records, reports, and payment and escrow histories, in any format, arising from or related to the servicing of the mortgage loan or acquired property by the current servicer or any prior servicer. This includes those required at any time by the Lender Contract or an insurer and documents and records set forth in the Servicing Guide. The loan servicing ﬁle must also include copies of all documents or records that are used to evaluate a borrower and the property condition when determining the eligibility for a workout option.

has no right to possess these documents and records except under the conditions speciﬁed by Fannie Mae, and
must hold these documents solely for the beneﬁt of Fannie Mae.
The servicer must use the loan origination ﬁle to accumulate other pertinent servicing and liquidation information.
If the seller does not service the loan, it must transfer the loan ﬁle to the servicer. The servicer must document in the servicing loan ﬁle its compliance with all Fannie Mae policies and procedures, including timelines that are required by the Servicing Guide. The servicer and the responsible party must keep all of the individual loan records and all servicing records for the time it serviced the loan.
General Requirements for Records
The seller/servicer must:
maintain the accounting records relating to loans in accordance with sound and generally accepted accounting principles;
ensure that the records meet Fannie Mae’s requirements;
ensure the accuracy, security, conﬁdentiality, integrity, completeness and legibility of the individual loan ﬁle;
protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of ﬁles and records;
protect against unauthorized access to or use of ﬁles and records and is responsible for requiring, by contract, that any subservicers or other third parties that access mortgage ﬁles and records also implement these measures;
periodically review changes in technology to make sure that all records continue to be obtainable and readable in the future.

Description
Sellers/servicers may convert a paper document to an
electronic record for storage purposes if it is not one of
the documents required to be maintained in its original
paper form. Sellers/servicers may destroy the paper
document. Similarly, a seller/servicer may convert an
electronic record to a paper document for storage
purposes or to provide loan modiﬁcations to document
custodians that are not electronically enabled.
When documents are converted to an alternative
format, the legibility and integrity of the information and
formatting, including indications of alterations (such as
Conversion of documents
erasures and white-outs), in the original document must
be preserved.
If servicing of a loan is transferred, the servicer must
securely transfer all relevant electronic records to the
new servicer, along with all information verifying the
authenticity, validity and enforceability of the records
and any associated signatures.
Sellers/servicers must retain documentation that
explains the process used to convert paper-based
records to electronic formats and specify the date of
conversion, method of conversion, and disposition of the
original paper records.
For purposes of the preceding table, “electronic records” do not include eNotes, and paper notes may not be converted into eNotes. See B8-8-02, Requirements for Creating, Closing, and Correcting eNotes for additional information regarding electronic records.
Electronic Signatures
Sellers/servicers may use any form of electronic signature on an electronic record that is valid under applicable law (except that audio and video recordings cannot be used as the electronic signature), as long as the signature is attached to or logically associated with the record intended to be signed. From time to time, Fannie Mae may require a seller/servicer to use a speciﬁc signature format for a particular electronic record or type of record.

For electronically-signed records for loans purchased or
securitized by Fannie Mae, this evidence and
documentation must be suﬃcient to enable Fannie Mae
to conduct a thorough quality control review of the loan.
For example, the evidence of the borrower’s signature
with respect to a veriﬁcation of employment must allow
Fannie Mae the ability to request and receive a
reveriﬁcation of the information from the borrower’s
employer.

Description
A repurchase demand based on compliance with laws violation will
include supporting facts and ﬁndings made by Fannie Mae.
Fannie Mae’s determination that a violation has occurred must be
consistent with the facts provided by the seller/servicer and any other
information obtained by Fannie Mae as part of its evaluation of the
situation.
If Fannie Mae issues a repurchase demand involving a failure to comply
with laws when there is pending litigation underway for that same issue,
or when a government agency with authority to make a determination

the litigation is

concluded at trial in an adjudication, or
the government agency has made a ﬁnal determination (collectively,
the “Resolution”).
After the Resolution, the seller/servicer may request that Fannie Mae
review the appropriateness of the repurchase demand in light of the
Resolution. Fannie Mae will withdraw the repurchase demand where
appropriate.
A seller/servicer may be required to repurchase a loan that is in breach of the requirements of this topic at any time despite the fact that the loan is otherwise eligible for enforcement relief for breaches of certain underwriting and eligibility representations and warranties in accordance with the Selling Guide.
Reporting Requirements
The seller/servicer must notify Fannie Mae if, after conducting due diligence, it determines that a breach of a selling warranty related to compliance with laws has likely occurred. The seller/servicer’s notiﬁcation responsibilities depend on how many loans are aﬀected and whether the breach could warrant a repurchase demand based on the criteria described above.
Reporting Category 1
The seller/servicer must notify Fannie Mae if both of the following conditions occur:
the number of loans aﬀected by the same potential breach exceeds the lesser of 500 loans or 1% of the total number of loans delivered to Fannie Mae in the prior year, and
Published February 5, 2025
94
all potentially aﬀected loans were delivered to Fannie Mae within the same calendar quarter.
The notiﬁcation is required within 60 days of the later of:
the end of the calendar quarter in which such loans were delivered, or
discovery of the potential breach.
The seller/servicer must report these loans using the self-report functionality in Loan Quality Connect.
Note: If the calculation described above results in fewer than ﬁve potentially aﬀected loans, then the seller/servicer does not need to notify Fannie Mae.
Reporting Category 2
The following reporting requirements apply when:
the potential breach could warrant a repurchase demand, or
the number of loans aﬀected by the same type of potential breach delivered in the same calendar quarter does not exceed the lesser of 500 loans or 1% of the total number of loans delivered to Fannie Mae in the prior year.

Examples:
Scenario 1: A lender identiﬁes a repeated potential breach related to compliance with laws where a repurchase demand is not warranted.
The lender determines June 1 it may have failed to provide a property valuation when required under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. This impacted 600 loans that were delivered to Fannie Mae between January 1 and March 31. The lender must report the potential breach to Fannie Mae within 60 days of June 1. In this scenario, the number of loans impacted exceeded 500 loans and the loans were delivered within the same quarter.
Published February 5, 2025
95
Scenario 2: A lender that delivered 70,000 loans to Fannie Mae the prior year identiﬁes a repeated potential breach related to compliance with laws where a repurchase demand is not warranted.
The lender determines August 15 it may have failed to provide a property valuation when required under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. This impacted 200 loans that were delivered to Fannie Mae between January 1 and March 31, and 400 loans that were delivered to Fannie Mae between April 1 and June 30. The lender will not be required to report the potential breach for either quarter, as the number of loans impacted in each quarter did not exceed 500 loans. In this scenario, 500 loans is less than 700 loans (1% of prior year deliveries).
Scenario 3: A lender identiﬁes a single loan impacted by a potential breach for which a repurchase demand is a potential remedy.
The lender may have violated the Fair Housing Act. The lender must report the breach to Fannie Mae within 60 days of determination of the potential breach, unless it determines the non-compliance has been remedied or will be remedied within 60 days in accordance with applicable law.

A third-party origination is any loan that is completely or partially originated, processed, underwritten, packaged, funded, or closed by an entity other than the seller (or its parent company, controlled aﬃliate or subsidiary) that sells the loan to Fannie Mae. This includes mortgage brokers or correspondents, which are known as third-party originators. If a seller enters into a contract with a third party known for the quality of its underwriting (such as a mortgage insurer) to help the seller in underwriting its mortgage originations, the loans will not be considered third-party originations. Refer to Chapter E-3, Glossary for the deﬁnition of correspondent and broker. (Retail is also an origination type but is not considered a third-party origination.)
Sellers remain fully responsible to Fannie Mae for functions that are outsourced to third parties.
Certain Special Feature Codes (see Special Feature Codes) are required at delivery for third-party originations.
A seller must have eﬀective written policies and procedures for the approval and management of third-party originations and must satisfy itself that the third-party originator is capable of producing quality loans.
Management Procedures for Third-Party Originations
Eﬀective management procedures for third-party originations include the items in the table below.

Introduction This topic contains information on concurrent servicing transfers, including:
Concurrent Servicing Transfers Servicer Eligibility Criteria Servicing Assignment Contract Notiﬁcation of Concurrent Servicing Transfers Termination of Concurrent Servicing Transfers Servicing Marketplace Servicer Eligibility Criteria for Servicing Marketplace Seller Eligibility Criteria for Servicing Marketplace Servicing Marketplace (SMP) Bifurcation Terms and Conditions
Concurrent Servicing Transfers
A concurrent servicing transfer (also known as a transfer of servicing concurrent with delivery) occurs when a selling lender transfers the servicing rights for a loan to a Fannie Mae–approved servicer at the same time it sells the loan to Fannie Mae. This is an “automatic” transfer because Fannie Mae’s prior approval of the transaction is not required.
If the selling lender is servicing the loans prior to delivery and will not be servicing the loans after delivery, the selling lender may automatically transfer servicing to a lender that is eligible to service them for Fannie Mae, and has agreed to do so, eﬀective concurrently with delivery of the loans to Fannie Mae. The lender must notify Fannie Mae at the time of loan delivery that servicing has been transferred.
Additionally, the selling lender may designate the servicing lender as Fannie Mae’s servicer for the loans by notifying Fannie Mae at the time of delivery if:
the selling lender is not servicing the loans prior to delivery because it has contracted with another lender (the “servicing lender”) to service the loans for the selling lender;
Published February 5, 2025
108
the selling lender will not be servicing the loans after delivery;
the servicing lender is eligible to service the loans for Fannie Mae; and
the servicing lender agrees to service the loans for Fannie Mae, which requires the contractual servicing relationship be with Fannie Mae instead of with the seller.
If the servicing lender wants the contractual servicing relationship to be with the selling lender instead of with Fannie Mae, even after delivery of the loans to Fannie Mae, the selling lender must become Fannie Mae’s servicer (as “master servicer”), and the servicing lender must become a “subservicer.” (See A3-3-03, Other Servicing Arrangements, and the Servicing Guide.)
A transfer of servicing that becomes eﬀective concurrent with delivery of the loans to Fannie Mae must be implemented in accordance with the requirements in the Servicing Guide.
After Fannie Mae has purchased or securitized a loan, Fannie Mae must approve all subsequent assignments of servicing related to that loan before the servicing can be transferred. See the Servicing Guide for additional requirements.
Servicer Eligibility Criteria
The transferee servicer must meet Fannie Mae’s eligibility criteria that apply to a lender that becomes Fannie Mae’s servicer in a post-delivery transfer of servicing as described in the Servicing Guide.
Servicing Assignment Contract
The servicing transfer agreement between the lender and the transferee servicer must provide (among other requirements) that:
the eﬀective date for transfer of the servicing of the loans will be no later than the date Fannie Mae funds the whole loan delivery or issues the MBS;
Fannie Mae may request and obtain (at any time) a copy of such agreement; and
the agreement must provide, for the stated beneﬁt of Fannie Mae, that the transferee servicer, as of the eﬀective date:
accepts the servicing portfolio and agrees to service the loans in accordance with all Fannie Mae requirements;
assumes responsibility for all of the lender’s contractual obligations related to all servicing duties, obligations and responsibilities related to the loans that arose prior to the delivery of the loans to Fannie Mae;
has performed due diligence review(s) of the servicing portfolio to its satisfaction, which includes examination of the books, records, and custodial accounts of the lender with respect to the servicing portfolio;
assumes full responsibility to Fannie Mae for the correctness of such books and records; and
represents and warrants that the provisions of any agreement between the servicer and any other party providing for servicing the loans will not continue after the date on which Fannie Mae funds
Published February 5, 2025
109
the whole loan delivery or issues the MBS.
By accepting a transfer of servicing, the transferee servicer agrees to the above matters and represents and warrants that they are correct (as applicable), even in those cases in which the contractual relationship between the lender and the transferee servicer is such that no agreement to assign the servicing is legally necessary at the time the loans are delivered to Fannie Mae.
Further, by designating another lender as servicer of the loans on the applicable loan schedule, the lender represents and warrants that with respect to such loans:
the servicer has agreed to the above matters and represents and warrants that they are correct (as applicable), and
the provisions of any agreement between the lender and any other party providing for servicing of the loans will not continue after the date on which Fannie Mae funds the whole loan delivery or issues the MBS.
However, the lender is not released from any liabilities to Fannie Mae with respect to the loans or the servicing of them prior to the delivery of the loans to Fannie Mae. The lender and the servicer will be jointly and severally liable to Fannie Mae for the obligations and liabilities related to the loans or the servicing of them that arise before delivery of the loans to Fannie Mae.
In addition to the requirements of this section, a transfer of servicing that becomes eﬀective concurrent with delivery of the loans to Fannie Mae must be implemented in accordance with Fannie Mae’s requirements in the Servicing Guide.
After Fannie Mae has purchased or securitized a loan, Fannie Mae must approve all subsequent assignments of servicing related to that loan before the servicing can be transferred.
Notiﬁcation of Concurrent Servicing Transfers
The lender must notify Fannie Mae of the transferee servicer by entering the transferee servicer's nine-digit Fannie Mae seller/servicer number into the Loan Delivery application.
Termination of Concurrent Servicing Transfers
If a concurrent servicing transfer does not meet Fannie Mae’s eligibility standards as stated in this Guide and in the Servicing Guide, Fannie Mae is entitled to terminate the transferee’s servicing with respect to the aﬀected loans in order to transfer servicing of the loans to another servicer, pursuant to Fannie Mae's rights under the MSSC. The lender is obligated for all losses incurred by Fannie Mae resulting from the lender’s designation of an ineligible servicer.
For additional information about concurrent servicing transfers, see the Servicing Guide.
Servicing Marketplace
The Servicing Marketplace is a committing platform that provides a standardized process for sellers and
Published February 5, 2025
110
servicers who engage in concurrent servicing transfer transactions. Seller and servicer obligations for loans sold and servicing acquired via the Servicing Marketplace will be bifurcated under the terms and conditions below.
Servicer Eligibility Criteria for Servicing Marketplace
The transferee servicer must:
meet Fannie Mae’s eligibility criteria that apply to a lender that becomes Fannie Mae’s servicer in a post- delivery transfer of servicing as described in the Servicing Guide, and obtain Fannie Mae's approval to participate in Servicing Marketplace.
See A2-1-01, Contractual Obligations for Sellers/Servicers for additional information.
Seller Eligibility Criteria for Servicing Marketplace
In order to be eligible as a seller for Servicing Marketplace, at a minimum, sellers must meet and maintain an Adjusted Net Worth, calculated in accordance with A4-1-01, Maintaining Seller/Servicer Eligibility, of at least $2.5 million, plus an amount equal to the greater of:
the sum of the following:
0.25% of the Residential First Lien Mortgage Servicing UPB serviced for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, plus 0.35% of the Residential First Lien Mortgage Servicing UPB serviced for Ginnie Mae, plus 0.25% of the Other Servicing UPB, or
0.25% of the UPB of whole loans purchased by Fannie Mae that were committed in the preceding 36 months via Servicing Marketplace.
The minimum Adjusted Net Worth does not include loans serviced under a subservicing arrangement - that is, for which the seller/servicer is contractually obligated to service for another servicer.
If these minimum requirements are met, Fannie Mae may, but is not required to, approve and activate the seller for Servicing Marketplace. A seller may view whether it has seller access to Servicing Marketplace by logging into the Fannie Mae whole loan committing application. Fannie Mae, in its discretion at any time, may terminate a seller’s participation in Servicing Marketplace, which will be eﬀective immediately.
Servicing Marketplace (SMP) Bifurcation Terms and Conditions
Using SMP in Fannie Mae’s whole loan committing application, lenders may arrange for a concurrent sale of servicing to an approved Fannie Mae servicer. See C2-1.3-01, Servicing Marketplace, for additional information.
A lender approved as a seller for SMP transactions is directly liable to Fannie Mae for the obligations and liabilities related to the SMP loans, including all selling representations and warranties required to be made by a seller, and for obligations and liabilities related to servicing of the SMP loans that arise before delivery of the loans to Fannie Mae. The servicer retained by the lender concurrent with Fannie Mae’s acquisition of the loan (and any transferee servicer to whom servicing rights and obligations with respect to an SMP loan have been transferred by the servicer with approval from Fannie Mae) is responsible for the servicing duties, obligations and responsibilities related to the loan that arise both prior to Fannie Mae’s acquisition of the loan and
Published February 5, 2025
111
thereafter, but otherwise the servicer (and any transferee servicer as previously described in this paragraph) has no liability and is not responsible for breaches of any of the selling lender’s selling representations, warranties, obligations or liabilities related to the SMP loans.
The lender’s sale of SMP loans to Fannie Mae is subject to the following requirements:
Upon the sale of a SMP loan to Fannie Mae, the lender makes all representations and warranties required to be made by a seller under this Selling Guide.
The lender acknowledges and agrees that:
Fannie Mae is entitled to enforce directly against the lender, and the lender is liable for, any and all remedies (including, without limitation, repurchase) for a breach of the lender’s obligations and liabilities related to the SMP loans. Fannie Mae is under no obligation to enforce or attempt to enforce any such remedies against the servicer.
Without limiting the provisions of the Guides, the lender must resolve repurchase requests with respect to SMP loans within the time and manner required by the Servicing Guide. Failure to do so may result in termination of the lender’s approval to participate in SMP, as well as any other remedies Fannie Mae may elect to pursue.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Lender Contract or any other agreement between the lender and Fannie Mae, by its sale of SMP loans to Fannie Mae, the lender:
authorizes Fannie Mae to disclose from time to time to the applicable servicer any information (and any related assessments and analyses developed by Fannie Mae) that Fannie Mae may have concerning the lender (including, for example, information related to the lender’s ﬁnancial condition and relationship with Fannie Mae), the SMP loans, the servicing of SMP loans and related quality control reports, and waives any requirement that Fannie Mae maintain the conﬁdentiality of such information to the extent such requirement would otherwise prohibit such disclosure; and
shall have no rights or claims against Fannie Mae in connection with such disclosure or transfer of information, and waives any and all claims arising out of or based upon the conﬁdential nature of such information.
The lender acknowledges that Fannie Mae may, at its sole discretion:
from time to time, amend or supplement Fannie Mae’s procedures and requirements for the purchase of SMP loans, by publishing such amendments or supplementary material in the Selling Guide or in other written communications; and
terminate the lender’s approval to participate in SMP by delivering notice to the lender at any time.
The servicer of SMP loans sold to Fannie Mae is subject to the following requirements:
The servicer must service all SMP loans in accordance with the requirements of the Servicing Guide. The servicer waives all rights of recourse against Fannie Mae regarding any sale, transfer or acceptance of SMP loan servicing. If the servicer desires to transfer servicing of any SMP loan, it must comply with the terms of the Servicing Guide and clearly identify all such loans in its request for Fannie Mae's approval of a transfer of servicing. Fannie Mae is authorized to disclose from time to time to the applicable seller any information provided by the servicer concerning SMP loans, including any SMP loan servicing and quality control reports. The servicer waives any requirement that Fannie Mae maintain the conﬁdentiality of such information to the extent such requirement would otherwise prohibit such disclosure. In addition, the servicer agrees that it
Published February 5, 2025
112
has no rights or claims against Fannie Mae in connection with such disclosure or transfer of information and waives all claims arising out of or based upon the conﬁdential nature of any such information. The servicer may be asked to provide to the applicable seller certain performance data relating to SMP loans which have experienced delinquency and for which there is an increased risk that Fannie Mae or a third party may seek repurchase or other remedies (At Risk loans). The servicer agrees that, in connection with any disclosure of performance data for At Risk loans it elects to provide to a seller:
The servicer is solely responsible for performing (and has performed) its own analysis of, and determination that any disclosures of performance data are in compliance with the Gramm-Leach- Bliley Act privacy rules and other applicable legal requirements. In making disclosures of performance data, the servicer has not relied upon any representations or legal advice of Fannie Mae, whether oral or written, regarding compliance with privacy laws. The servicer may limit the seller's use of such data to improve its origination processes to prevent future fraud, risk control/estimation of potential repurchase, make whole or indemniﬁcation obligations in connection with such At Risk loans or such other purpose as the servicer deems appropriate.
Fannie Mae, at its sole discretion, may:
from time to time, amend or supplement Fannie Mae's procedures and requirements for the purchase of SMP loans, by publishing such amendments or supplementary material in this Guide or in other written communications; and terminate the servicer's approval to participate in SMP by delivering notice to the servicer at any time. The provisions of the Guides relating to SMP loans (including that the servicer has no liability and is not responsible for breaches of any of the selling lender's selling representations, warranties, obligations or liabilities related to the SMP loans) will survive termination of the servicer's participation in SMP but only as to SMP loans for which the servicer acquired the related loan servicing prior to the termination of its participation in SMP.

A3-3-03, Other Servicing Arrangements (12/15/2015)
Introduction This topic provides an overview of other servicing arrangements, including:
Subservicing General Requirements for Subservicing Arrangements Pledge of Servicing Rights and Transfer of Interest in Servicing Income
Subservicing
A lender may use other organizations to perform some or all of its servicing functions. Fannie Mae refers to these arrangements as “subservicing” arrangements, meaning that a servicer (the “subservicer”) other than the contractually responsible servicer (the “master” servicer) is performing the servicing functions.
The following are not considered to be subservicing arrangements:
when a computer service bureau is used to perform accounting and reporting functions;
when the originating lender sells and assigns servicing to another lender, unless the originating lender continues to be the contractually responsible servicer.
General Requirements for Subservicing Arrangements
A servicer may use a subservicer only if it will not interfere with the servicer’s ability to meet Fannie Mae’s remitting and reporting requirements.
A master servicer may not enter into new subservicing arrangements—or extend existing arrangements to include newly originated mortgages—unless both the master servicer and the subservicer are Fannie Mae- approved servicers in good standing who are able to perform the duties associated with the master servicer/subservicer arrangement.
The master servicer must ensure that its written agreement with the subservicer acknowledges Fannie Mae’s right to rescind its recognition of the subservicing arrangement if Fannie Mae decides to transfer the master servicer’s portfolio for any reason.
Published February 5, 2025
114
The master servicer must conﬁrm its existing subservicing arrangements when it submits the Lender Record Information (Form 582) each year.
For additional information concerning subservicer and master servicer duties, responsibilities, and other requirements, see the Servicing Guide on Fannie Mae’s website.
Pledge of Servicing Rights and Transfer of Interest in Servicing Income
A lender may enter into one of the following transactions, provided that the purpose of the transaction is a purpose permitted by Fannie Mae and the lender obtains Fannie Mae’s prior written consent:
a pledge, or grant of a security interest in, the servicing rights to all or part of its Fannie Mae servicing portfolio, including mortgage loans in MBS pools (a “pledge of servicing”);
a sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, or hypothecation of all or any portion of its compensation in excess of the amount needed to service mortgage loans for Fannie Mae (“excess servicing compensation”); or
a sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or hypothecation of all or any portion of its right to receive reimbursement of servicing advances.
Note: A transaction in either of the last two bullets above is referred to as a “transfer of an interest in servicing income.”
A lender may enter into a pledge of servicing or a transfer of an interest in servicing income for the following purposes only:
to fund the acquisition and performance of required servicing activities for additional servicing and/or servicing portfolios;
to provide collateral for warehouse lines of credit; or
to eﬀect the purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of a mortgage banking company, including a management buyout of its existing company, or a buyout of the controlling ownership interests of existing shareholders.
The lender must request Fannie Mae’s prior approval of a speciﬁc pledging transaction or transfer of an interest in servicing income at least 30 days prior to the proposed eﬀective date.
A pledge of servicing transaction between the lender and the secured creditor must be documented by a security agreement agreed to by the lender and the secured creditor. The lender, the secured creditor, and Fannie Mae must also execute an acknowledgment agreement acceptable to Fannie Mae, which sets forth the rights and responsibilities of the lender, the secured creditor, and Fannie Mae.
A transfer of an interest in servicing income transaction between the lender and the purchaser or ﬁnancier must be documented by a purchase and sale, security or ﬁnancing agreement in a form agreed to by the lender and the purchaser or ﬁnancier. The lender, the purchaser or ﬁnancier, and Fannie Mae must also execute a subordination of interest agreement acceptable to Fannie Mae, which sets forth the rights and responsibilities of the lender, the purchaser or ﬁnancier, and Fannie Mae.
For additional information about the terms and provisions of the security agreement and the acknowledgment agreement, see the Servicing Guide .

Introduction This topic provides general information on document custodians, including:
General Requirements Selection of a Document Custodian Documentation of the Relationship Additional Seller/Servicer Obligations Related to Document Custodians
General Requirements
Certain documents related to Fannie Mae loans must be held by a Fannie Mae-approved document custodian. The document custodian is acting on behalf of the seller/servicer and Fannie Mae when certifying loan documents and data at the time of acquisition by Fannie Mae. The roles and responsibilities of the document custodian are described in the Fannie Mae Requirements for Document Custodians (RDC guide).
Selection of a Document Custodian
For whole loans and MBS loans (excluding eNotes), the seller/servicer must use one of Fannie Mae's active document custodians.
For whole loans or MBS loans delivered as eNotes, Fannie Mae is the document custodian but has designated certain third parties to certify eNotes. The seller/servicer must use an approved third party to certify eNotes to Fannie Mae.
Fannie Mae may require a seller/servicer or document custodian to transfer documents to a diﬀerent document custodian, even if the current custodian satisﬁes Fannie Mae's requirements.
Refer to Fannie Mae's Active Document Custodians for a complete list of eligible document custodians.
Documentation of the Relationship
The seller must add the document custodian to its proﬁle within the Loan Delivery application. For all mortgage loans, the document custodian will certify the loans through the Document Certiﬁcation application.
Each custodian arrangement must be evidenced by the execution of a Master Custodial Agreement (Form 2017). Form 2017 covers custodial arrangements for both whole loans and MBS loans. The seller/servicer sends
Published February 5, 2025
116
the completed Form 2017 to the document custodian for execution. Upon receipt, the document custodian will send the seller/servicer ancillary documentation for completion. After the documentation and onboarding are complete, Fannie Mae and the document custodian will execute Form 2017. A copy of the fully executed Form 2017 will be returned to the seller/servicer for its records.

Description
A seller/servicer must establish appropriate methods for
monitoring the ﬁnancial viability and operational
capabilities of any document custodian it uses, which
include, at a minimum:
an annual review of information about the document
custodian’s internal audits, and
a quarterly review of the document custodian’s ﬁnancial
rating (or its parent’s or subsidiary’s ratings if the

custodian is not a regulated institution).
Should the ﬁnancial rating fall below the minimum
criteria, the seller or servicer must immediately notify
their Fannie Mae Servicing Consultant and send an email
notiﬁcation to Fannie Mae's Custodian Oversight and
Monitoring department (see E-1-02, List of Contacts).
Fannie Mae will determine whether it will allow the
documents to remain with the current document
custodian or require them to be transferred to an
acceptable document custodian.
The servicer must provide to the document custodian an
electronic list that identiﬁes, by Fannie Mae loan number,

Overview of Custodian Documents Release of Custodial Documents Transfer and Recertiﬁcation of Custodial Documents
Overview of Custodian Documents
Custodial documents are the legal mortgage documents an approved document custodian takes into physical custody when Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes a loan. The following documents are key custodial documents for whole loans and MBS loans. All other documents may be held in the individual loan ﬁle maintained by the seller/servicer.

See E-2-01, Required Custodial Documents for additional documentation requirements.
Release of Custodial Documents
The document custodian must not release custodial documents for either whole loans or MBS loans unless it receives a written request (including in electronic form) containing substantially the same information as required by Request for Release/Return of Documents (Form 2009).
Transfer and Recertiﬁcation of Custodial Documents
The servicer of any Fannie Mae loan may transfer related custodial documents to any document custodian with which it has executed a Master Custodial Agreement (Form 2017). The servicer must send a request to Fannie Mae’s Custodian Oversight team and include the name of the transferor and transferee custodians and the list of loans requested for transfer (see E-1-02, List of Contacts). Fannie Mae will provide approval for the transfer, which the servicer will be responsible for providing to the transferee and transferor document custodians. The
Published February 5, 2025
119
servicer must make appropriate arrangements for the safe transfer of the custodial documents to the new custodian’s facilities and for the payment of all costs related to the transfer.
Recertiﬁcation of custodial documents is required when there is a transfer of
documents by the existing servicer to a new document custodian, or
servicing (whether or not there is a change in document custodian).
If a transferee servicer does not want to use the same document custodian that has been holding custodial documents for loans included in a servicing transfer, it must inform Fannie Mae of the change in document custodian arrangements when it sends the Request for Approval of Servicing or Subservicing Transfer (Form 629). The transferee servicer should not submit a custodial agreement executed by the new document custodian(s) until after it receives notiﬁcation that the servicing transfer has been approved.
The transferor servicer must provide the existing document custodian and the new document custodian with a data ﬁle that provides certain loan-level information for each loan for which custodial documents are being transferred. The servicer must include the documentation in a separate loan ﬁle for each loan being transferred. When the servicer sends individual ﬁles, it should band (or box) them together with the trial balance to ensure that the new document custodian can associate the documents with what is delivered in each box.

General Requirements
A seller/servicer often obtains conﬁdential information about borrowers, security property, Fannie Mae technologies, products or services and Fannie Mae’s business when performing underwriting, origination, selling, servicing, or other activities under the Lender Contract or when previewing technologies, products or services (“Conﬁdential Information”).
Conﬁdential Information includes nonpublic personal information (NPI) and all of the following:

The seller/servicer must...
Take appropriate steps to ensure the security, integrity, and conﬁdentiality of Conﬁdential
Information.
Comply with all relevant applicable laws and regulations, including laws protecting
borrower privacy.
Not disclose Conﬁdential Information to third parties, without Fannie Mae’s prior written
approval, except on a need-to-know basis to the seller/servicer’s partners, aﬃliates,
oﬃcers, employees, directors, contractors, counsels, agents, or representatives, provided
they are subject to conﬁdentiality obligations at least as stringent as those set forth in this
topic.
Note: These restrictions do not apply to the extent the seller/servicer is required to
disclose the Conﬁdential Information by applicable law, provided that the seller/servicer
uses all reasonable eﬀorts to give Fannie Mae notice at least ten business days prior to
such disclosure; and
discloses only that portion of the Conﬁdential Information that the seller/servicer’s legal
counsel determines is legally required to be furnished, and request that the information
remain conﬁdential.
The requirement to provide Fannie Mae notice is waived if the seller/servicer
is required by law to disclose in conﬁdence Conﬁdential Information in response to
requests from a governmental agency, regulator, or self-regulatory authority that has
authority to regulate or oversee the seller/servicer’s business (including bank examiners,
securities examiners, and regulators’ inspector general oﬃces); and
formally requests that the information be treated in conﬁdence and exempt from the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and other open records laws requests.
Not use Conﬁdential Information in any way that could be viewed as
a conﬂict of interest
a breach of conﬁdentiality or privacy, or
the gaining of an unfair advantage from the seller/servicer’s relationship with Fannie
Mae.
Employ methods for securely disposing or destroying Conﬁdential Information.
Implement commercially reasonable measures meeting or exceeding industry standards to
ensure the security, integrity, and conﬁdentiality of Conﬁdential Information which, at a
minimum must meet the requirements outlined in the Supplement.
Promptly notify Fannie Mae in accordance with the requirements in the Supplement.

Introduction This topic contains information on preventing, detecting, and reporting mortgage fraud, including:
Overview Seller/Servicer Fraud Prevention Measures Tools and Resources
Overview
Fannie Mae takes mortgage fraud very seriously and seeks to work with its sellers/servicers to prevent and detect mortgage fraud. There are two primary motivations for committing mortgage fraud.
Fraud for house is motivated by a desire to get a marginal borrower into a house and may involve misrepresentation of information on loan applications.
Fraud for proﬁt is motivated by a desire of mortgage participants to improperly acquire mortgage loan proceeds for personal gain. Often fraud for proﬁt schemes involve a pattern: two or more mortgage loans, multiple parties in various roles within the mortgage industry, and no true intent to repay the mortgage. Participants in fraud schemes can include borrowers, originators, appraisers, brokers, real estate agents, closing agents, builders, lenders, and title companies.
There are a variety of types of mortgage fraud including:
undisclosed liabilities,
misrepresentation of income or employment,
misrepresentation of credit,
identity theft and/or Social Security number discrepancy,
misrepresentation of assets,
misrepresentation of occupancy,
misrepresentation of property value,
property ﬂips based on inﬂated appraisals or other false characteristics,
misrepresentation of the subject property characteristics or comparables,
sale of fraudulent loans or double selling of loans,
mishandling of escrow funds or custodial accounts,
diversion of sales proceeds, and
fraudulent payoﬀ schemes.

Seller/Servicer Fraud Prevention Measures
Fannie Mae assumes the information and processes on which loan decisions are based are honest, accurate, and credible, and that sellers/servicers are striving for information and process integrity at every stage in the life of a mortgage—from application through servicing.
The following table contains general requirements related to fraud prevention.
✓
The seller/servicer must establish and maintain written policies and procedures to:
have proper hiring practices in place.
conﬁrm the individual or company does not appear on the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s
Suspended Counterparty Program list before engaging the services of any contractor or vendor
or other individual involved in activities related to the origination or servicing of loans owned by
Fannie Mae.
be selective in choosing closing attorneys and settlement agents and communicate concerns
about suspicious ﬁles to these individuals.
report suspected fraud to the proper authorities and to Fannie Mae.
In addition to the requirements above, the seller must:
aggressively sample loans that have a high risk for fraud as part of the quality control process, evaluate appraisers and get references. Conﬁrm the appraiser is currently licensed and has not been the subject of disciplinary action, and modify closing instructions to prevent ﬂips without lender consent.

If the seller/servicer obtains third-party originated loans, the seller/servicer must conﬁrm
the third-party originator has a documented procedure for checking their potential
employees against the lists.
A seller/servicer must notify Fannie Mae if a reasonable basis exists to conclude any
misrepresentation or fraud occurred in connection with the origination, sale, or
servicing of the loan.
Before notifying Fannie Mae about any misrepresentation or fraud, a

Introduction
This chapter describes Fannie Mae’s ﬁdelity bond and errors and omissions coverage and policy requirements.
A3-5-01, Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions Coverage Provisions
(07/25/2017)
Introduction This topic contains information on ﬁdelity bond and errors and omissions insurance coverage provisions.
Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions Coverage Provisions
Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions Coverage Provisions
A seller/servicer must have a blanket ﬁdelity bond and an errors and omissions insurance policy in eﬀect at all times in an amount suﬃcient to meet Fannie Mae’s minimum coverage requirements described in A3-5-02, Fidelity Bond Policy Requirements and A3-5-03, Errors and Omissions Policy Requirements.
A seller/servicer that is a subsidiary of another institution may use its parent’s ﬁdelity bond and errors and omissions insurance policy as long as it is named as a joint insured under the bond or policy. However, if the parent’s deductible amount exceeds the maximum deductible that Fannie Mae allows as required in A3-5-02, Fidelity Bond Policy Requirements, the seller/servicer must obtain a ﬁdelity bond in its own name for an amount that is at least equal to the amount of the parent’s deductible, with a separate deductible amount that is no higher than the maximum amount Fannie Mae allows for the seller/servicer’s coverage.
Published February 5, 2025
128
Fannie Mae will accept coverage underwritten by an insurer that is aﬃliated with Lloyd’s of London.
Fannie Mae will consider the use of captive reinsurance arrangements on a case-by-case basis.
Each ﬁdelity bond and errors and omissions insurance policy must include the following provisions:
Fannie Mae is named as a “loss payee” on drafts the insurer issues to pay for covered losses incurred by Fannie Mae;
Fannie Mae has the right to ﬁle a claim directly with the insurer if the seller/servicer fails to ﬁle a claim for a covered loss incurred by Fannie Mae when reasonably available;
Fannie Mae will be notiﬁed at least 30 days before the insurer cancels, reduces, declines to renew, or imposes a restrictive modiﬁcation to the seller/servicer’s coverage for any reason other than a partial or full exhaustion of the insurer’s limit of liability under the policy; and
a provision that the insurer will notify Fannie Mae within ten days after the insurer receives a seller/servicer’s request to cancel or reduce any coverage.
The seller/servicer must provide Fannie Mae a copy of its ﬁdelity bond or errors and omissions insurance certiﬁcate within 30 days of Fannie Mae’s request. If the seller/servicer obtains an endorsement to the bond or policy or obtains additional coverage, it should also provide Fannie Mae a copy of the endorsement or a description of the additional coverage, unless the information can be summarized substantively on the insurance certiﬁcate.
The insurance certiﬁcate should indicate:
the insurer’s name,
the bond or policy number,
the named insured,
the type and amount of coverage (specifying whether the insurer’s liability limits are on an aggregate loss or per mortgage basis),
the eﬀective date of the coverage, and
the deductible amount.

Fidelity Bond Coverage Requirements
The ﬁdelity bond must insure against losses resulting from dishonest or fraudulent acts committed by:
the seller/servicer’s principal owner,
the seller/servicer’s personnel,
any employees of outside ﬁrms that provide legal services to the seller/servicer or data processing services for the seller/servicer or other accounting records for the seller/servicer, and
persons assigned to the seller/servicer through an intervening employer or agency to perform the usual duties of an employee of the seller/servicer on a contingent or temporary basis and interns.
For corporate seller/servicers, Fannie Mae will accept coverage under the following types of ﬁdelity bonds:
Mortgage Bankers Blanket Bond Policy,
Savings and Loan Blanket Bond Policy, or
Bankers Blanket Bond Policy.
Fidelity Bond Coverage and Deductible Amounts
As described in the table below, the ﬁdelity bond coverage must be equal to a percentage of, the greater of the seller/servicer’s annual
total UPB of single-family and multifamily annual mortgage loan originations; or
highest monthly total UPB of single-family and multifamily servicing of mortgage loans that the seller/servicer owns, including mortgage loans owned by the seller/servicer and serviced by others.
Note: If the seller/servicer uses a subservicing arrangement, the master servicer must maintain ﬁdelity bond coverage at all times for the servicing of mortgage loans that it owns but that the subservicer services for that master servicer. A subservicer must only maintain coverage for mortgage loans that it owns. (See Servicing Guide A2-1-07, Subservicing for additional information about subservicing arrangements).
The ﬁdelity bond coverage amount and maximum deductible limit is determined in accordance with the requirements in the following table. The maximum amount of ﬁdelity bond coverage required is $150 million.

Errors and Omissions Coverage Requirements
The errors and omissions policy must, at least, protect the seller/servicer against negligence, errors, and omissions in:
maintaining property and ﬂood insurance that meets Fannie Mae’s requirements,
maintaining any required mortgage insurance or loan guaranty,
Published February 5, 2025
131
determining whether properties are located in Special Flood Hazard Areas,
paying real estate taxes and any special assessments, and
complying with reporting requirements of the mortgage insurer or guarantor.
Errors and Omissions Coverage and Deductible Amounts
The errors and omissions coverage must equal the amount of the seller/servicer’s ﬁdelity bond coverage. See the formula in A3-5-02, Fidelity Bond Policy Requirements to determine the amount of coverage required. However, Fannie Mae does not require errors and omissions coverage in excess of:
$10 million if the seller/servicer sells or services only single-family mortgage loans, or
$30 million if the seller/servicer sells or services single-family and multifamily mortgage loans.
Note: If the seller/servicer uses a subservicing arrangement, the master servicer must maintain errors and omissions coverage at all times for the servicing of mortgage loans that it owns but that the subservicer services for that master servicer. A subservicer must only maintain coverage for mortgage loans that it owns. (See the Servicing Guide A2-1-07, Subservicing for additional information about subservicing arrangements.)
Fannie Mae accepts policies that provide for either coverage per aggregate loss or coverage per mortgage loan. If the policy provides coverage per mortgage loan:
the insurer’s liability must at least equal the amount of the highest UPB for a single-family or multifamily mortgage loan. that the seller/servicer owns, and
the seller/servicer must review the balances of the mortgage loans it services before each premium renewal date to determine whether the above limitation needs to be increased as the result of the origination of higher balance mortgage loans during the last coverage period.
For policies that provide coverage per mortgage loan, the maximum deductible amount for each mortgage loan cannot be more than 5% of the insurer’s liability per mortgage loan.
For policies that provide coverage per aggregate loss, the deductible is determined in accordance with the following table:
Total UPB
Maximum Deductible
Less than $1 billion
greater of $100,000 or 10% of the face amount of the
policy
Equal to or greater than $1 billion

advance lines of credit;
a breach by any seller/servicer’s aﬃliate or related entity in any of its obligations with Fannie Mae,
including parental guarantees;
a breach of any agreements with any other creditors where such breach involves an amount that
exceeds 3% of the seller/servicer’s Lender Adjusted Net Worth;
a breach of, or an impairment of any rights contained in any agreement that is material to the
seller/servicer's origination of loans eligible for sale to Fannie Mae, servicing of Fannie Mae loans, the
Cross-Default Provisions
ﬁnancial or business condition or operations of the seller/servicer, or the seller/servicer's ability to
comply with the Lender Contract;
the occurrence of any change event, or circumstance which has or could reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse eﬀect on the seller/servicer's origination of loans, servicing of Fannie Mae
loans, on the ﬁnancial or business condition or operations of the seller/servicer, or the ability to
comply with the Lender Contract.
An impairment of rights is any event that may restrict the ability of the seller or servicer to conduct
its business, continue to sell loans, or service any loan assets in the regular course of its business.
The seller/servicer must provide Fannie Mae with written notiﬁcation in the form of an updated
Lender Record Information ( Form 582) submission and email notiﬁcation to the Changes in Lender
Organization mailbox (see E-1-02, List of Contacts) within ﬁve business days of the occurrence of any
of the foregoing.
Recourse Obligation
Fannie Mae may permit a seller/servicer to take on credit recourse obligations, provided the seller/servicer meets certain requirements. Fannie Mae will assess the ﬁnancial strength of the seller/servicer to determine whether the seller/servicer can take on credit recourse obligations and, if permitted, whether the seller/servicer must post collateral or provide other forms of risk reduction measures to secure the additional obligations.
Business Continuity Management and Disaster Recovery
Published February 5, 2025
139
Fannie Mae requires seller/servicer to have a Business Continuity Plan. This plan must include Business Continuity Procedures and Disaster Recovery Procedures, as deﬁned in the Supplement. It must also identify business processes critical to the continuation of services and operations including those necessary to comply with obligations the seller/servicer has to Fannie Mae under the Lender Contract. The seller/servicer's Business Continuity Plan, Business Continuity Procedures and Disaster Recovery Procedures must meet the requirements of the Supplement.
Additionally, the seller/servicer must ensure it and any subservicers, third-party originators, outsourcing ﬁrms, and third-party vendors used by the seller/servicer implement and maintain disaster recovery and business continuity procedures. These procedures must ensure the ability to regain critical business operations if there is a disruption or disaster. This includes back-up systems, procedures and processes in the event of the expiration or termination of any contract that is material for seller/servicer's servicing of Fannie Mae loans, origination of loans for sale to Fannie Mae, or ability to comply with the Lender Contract. The lender must provide a copy of its Business Continuity Plan and Business Continuity Procedures to Fannie Mae upon Fannie Mae's written request.
Audit and Management Control Requirements
The seller/servicer must have internal audit and management control procedures to evaluate and monitor the overall quality of its loan production and servicing processes, as applicable. At a minimum:
The procedures must be independent of all key functions of the loan manufacturing process and the servicing processes that they review, so that such procedures provide an objective and unbiased evaluation that adds value and improves the seller/servicer’s operations.
The seller/servicer’s lines of reporting must reﬂect the independence of the audit process at all levels, resulting in activities that are conducted in an unbiased manner and without quality compromises resulting from internal inﬂuences or conﬂicts of interest.
The audit function must not share any reporting lines with the functional areas that it reviews.
The audit function must report directly to the seller/servicer’s senior management and/or board of directors. Exceptions are permitted in situations in which the size of the seller/servicer’s organization is insuﬃcient to support adequate resources to allow for separation of these functions. In those situations, the seller/servicer’s audit plan must include the rationale for the lack of separation as well as the controls that have been established to mitigate the risks associated with the lack of separation of these functions.
The procedures must be consultative, so that they help the seller/servicer accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluating and improving the eﬀectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes.
Written Policies and Procedures
The seller should have eﬀective and fully documented written policies and/or procedures that ensure that its staﬀ, and any outsourcing and third-party vendors used by the seller, consistently comply with Fannie Mae's requirements. This may include providing training to its staﬀ and reviewing staﬃng needs on an ongoing basis.
Published February 5, 2025
140
Management of Vendors and Other Third-party Service Providers
Lenders must have written procedures for the approval and management of vendors and other third-party service providers. The procedures must comply with the business continuity requirements in the Supplement if the seller/servicer or any subservicer contracts with a vendor or third-party service provider for any critical servicing functions or ability to comply with the Lender Contract.

Financial Reporting Requirements Lender Record Information Form
Financial Reporting Requirements
The seller/servicer must demonstrate its ﬁnancial adequacy to Fannie Mae. To accomplish this, Fannie Mae requires the seller/servicer to submit ﬁnancial statements and other information described in this topic. A seller/servicer’s failure to timely provide the required information may result in Fannie Mae declaring a breach of the Lender Contract.
A seller/servicer must submit their annual Audited Financial Statement (AFS) within 90 days after the end of the seller/servicer’s ﬁscal year.
The requirements for the AFS are described in the following table.

a statement of additional paid-in capital,
a statement of changes in ﬁnancial position, and
all related notes.
If the seller/servicer’s ﬁnancial statement is consolidated with those of its parent or holding company, they must contain suﬃcient detail to enable Fannie Mae to review the seller/servicer’s ﬁnancial data separately from that of the other companies.
The AFS must be sent electronically to Fannie Mae’s Lender Eligibility and Compliance Unit (see E-1-02, List of Contacts). For submission instructions, see the Audited Financial Statement (AFS) page.

Additional Requirements for Financial Information
In addition, Fannie Mae may, at any time, require a seller/servicer to submit unaudited ﬁnancial statements, audited ﬁnancial statements other than the annual statements (if reasonably available), or any other ﬁnancial information that Fannie Mae considers necessary and reasonable.
Fannie Mae also has the right to require more frequent and more detailed ﬁnancial reporting from a seller/servicer or additional ﬁnancial requirements imposed by Fannie Mae on the seller/servicer.
Lender Record Information Form
The Lender Record Information ( Form 582) provides information needed to verify that the seller/servicer continues to meet Fannie Mae's basic eligibility requirements as well as certiﬁcations regarding compliance with our requirements. The seller/servicer must update its Form 582 electronically no later than 90 days after the end of the seller/servicer’s ﬁscal year. If there are changes to the lender's record information, the seller/servicer must update Form 582 and provide Fannie Mae with written notiﬁcation in the form of an email to the Changes in Lender Organization mailbox (see E-1-02, List of Contacts) within ﬁve business days of the occurrence of any of the following:

The seller/servicer is also required to provide immediate written notice to us if a regulatory agency assumes a participatory role in the management of the seller/servicer’s operations.
A seller/servicer’s failure to provide adequate written notice of or obtain prior written approval or notice of non- objection (where required) for such contemplated changes is a breach of the Lender Contract.
The seller/servicer must contact its customer account team for additional guidance or may email the notice to the Changes in Lender Organization mailbox (see E-1-02, List of Contacts).

Introduction This topic contains information on the contents of the application package, including:
Documenting the Loan Application Requirements for the Loan Application Package Uniform Underwriting and Transmittal Summary and DU Underwriting Analysis Report
Documenting the Loan Application
A loan application must be documented on the Uniform Residential Loan Application (Form 1003). A complete, signed, and dated version of the ﬁnal Form 1003 must always be included in the loan ﬁle. The ﬁnal Form 1003 must reﬂect the income, assets, debts, and ﬁnal loan terms used in the underwriting process. (See B3-2-10, Accuracy of DU Data, DU Tolerances, and Errors in the Credit Report for additional information about ensuring DU data accuracy and tolerances.)
If either the note or the security instrument and the ﬁnal Form 1003 will be executed pursuant to a power of attorney in accordance with this Guide, then the initial Form 1003 must be personally signed by the borrower (except as provided below) and included in the loan ﬁle. See B8-2-03, Signature Requirements for Security Instruments, B8-3-03, Signature Requirements for Notes, and B8-5-05, Requirements for Use of a Power of Attorney, for additional information. However, a power of attorney may be used to execute both the initial and ﬁnal Form 1003 in any of the following circumstances:

a borrower is on military service with the United States armed forces serving outside the United States or deployed aboard a United States vessel, as long as the power of attorney
expressly states an intention to secure a loan on a speciﬁc property, or
complies with the requirements under the VA Lender’s Handbook relating to powers of attorney for VA-insured mortgage loans,
the attorney-in-fact or agent signs the security instrument in their personal capacity with regard to their individual ownership interest in the mortgaged property; or
the lender determines such use is required by applicable law.
Note: The terms “loan application” and “Form 1003” generally mean the same thing in this Guide. The term “online loan application” refers to the DU user interface (or the lender’s loan origination system) where data is collected from the Form 1003, in addition to other loan data used in underwriting.
Requirements for the Loan Application Package
The table below provides the requirements for the loan application package.

Introduction This topic provides the Blanket Authorization form.
Blanket Authorization Form
Blanket Authorization Form
The lender obtains the borrower’s signature on the following Blanket Authorization form to obtain the documentation needed to evaluate the borrower’s creditworthiness.
This borrower-signed document gives the lender blanket authorization to request the information needed to document the borrower’s creditworthiness. I hereby authorize ___________________________ (the “lender”) to verify my past and present employment earnings records, bank accounts, stock holdings, and any other asset balances that are needed to process my mortgage loan application. I further authorize ______________________ (the “lender”) to order a consumer credit report and verify other credit information, including past and present mortgage and landlord references. It is understood that a photocopy of this form also will serve as authorization. The information the lender obtains is only to be used in the processing of my application for a mortgage loan.
The lender attaches a copy of the Blanket Authorization form to each Form 1005 or Form 1006 sent to a verifying institution. The information must be requested directly from the institution. The completed form(s) must be signed and dated, and must be sent directly from the verifying institution.

Allowable Age of Credit Documents Allowable Age of Federal Income Tax Returns
Allowable Age of Credit Documents
Published February 5, 2025
153
Credit documents include credit reports and employment, income, and asset documentation. For all mortgage loans (existing and new construction), the credit documents must be no more than four months old on the note date. When consecutive credit documents are in the loan ﬁle, the most recent document is used to determine whether it meets the age requirement. For example, when two consecutive monthly bank statements are used to verify a depository asset, the date of the most recent statement must be no more than four months old on the note date. If the credit documents are older than allowed, the lender must update them. For age requirements related to appraisals, see B4-1.2-04, Appraisal Age and Use Requirements. Also see B2-3-05, Properties Aﬀected by a Disaster for exceptions to the allowable age of credit documents for loans impacted by a natural disaster.
Allowable Age of Federal Income Tax Returns
For some types of sources of income, Fannie Mae requires lenders to obtain copies of federal income tax returns (personal returns and, if applicable, business returns). The “most recent year’s” tax return is deﬁned as the last return scheduled to have been ﬁled with the IRS. For example,

Documentation Required
The most recent year’s tax return is required. The
use of a Tax Extension (IRS Form 4868) is not
permitted.
The most recent year’s tax return is recommended;
however, the previous year(s) is also acceptable.
In the event the most recent year's tax return is not
obtained, the loan ﬁle must include a completed
and signed IRS Form 4506-C for transcripts of tax
returns provided by the borrower to the lender.
The most recent year’s tax return is recommended;
however, the previous year(s) is also acceptable.
In the event the most recent year's tax return is not
obtained, the lender must perform all of the
following:
Obtain one of the following documents from the
borrower:
⚬ copy of IRS Form 4868 (Application for
Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual
Income Tax Return) ﬁled with the IRS,
⚬ proof of the e-ﬁling of Form 4868, or
⚬ conﬁrmation of electronic payment(s),
including the conﬁrmation number, of all or part of
the estimated income taxes.
Review the total tax liability either reported on
IRS Form 4868 or paid by the borrower and
compare it with the borrower’s tax liability from the
most recent year obtained as a measure of income
source stability and continuance. An estimated tax
liability that is inconsistent with previous years may
make it necessary for the lender to require the
current returns in order to proceed.
Obtain IRS response from the ﬁling of IRS Form
4506–C conﬁrming that no transcripts are available
for the applicable tax year. (Alternatively, lenders

Overview
Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes mortgages secured by properties that are principal residences, second homes, or investment properties. For the maximum allowable LTV/CLTV/HCLTV ratios and credit score requirements for each occupancy type, see the Eligibility Matrix.
Principal Residence Properties
A principal residence is a property that the borrower occupies as their primary residence. The following table describes conditions under which Fannie Mae considers a residence to be a principal residence even though the borrower will not be occupying the property.
Borrower Types
Requirements for Owner Occupancy
Only one borrower must occupy and take title to the
property, except as otherwise required for mortgages
Multiple borrowers
that have guarantors or co-signers (see B2-2-04,
Guarantors, Co-Signers, or Non-Occupant Borrowers on
the Subject Transaction).
A military service member borrower currently on active
duty and temporarily absent from their principal
residence because of military service is considered to be
an owner occupant.
Lenders must verify the borrower's temporary absence
from the subject property by obtaining a copy of the
Military service members
borrower's military orders.
The military orders must evidence the borrower will be
absent from the subject property as of the date the owner
occupancy must be established as required by the
security instrument.
Loans that meet these requirements must be delivered
with Special Feature Code 754.

Introduction This topic contains information on LTV ratios, including:
Calculation of the LTV Ratio Sales Price and Appraised Value Used by DU Loan-Level Price Adjustments
Calculation of the LTV Ratio
The maximum allowable LTV ratio for a ﬁrst mortgage is based on a number of factors including, the representative credit score, the type of mortgage product, the number of dwelling units, and the occupancy status of the property.
The following table describes the requirements for calculating LTV ratios for a ﬁrst mortgage transaction. The result of these calculations must be truncated (shortened) to two decimal places, then rounded up to the nearest whole percent. For example:
94.01% will be delivered as 95%, and
80.001% will be delivered as 80%.
The rounding rules noted above also apply to the CLTV and HCLTV ratio calculations. Lenders' systems must contain rounding methodology that results in the same or a higher LTV ratio.

Refer to the Eligibility Matrix for maximum allowable LTV ratios.
Sales Price and Appraised Value Used by DU
DU uses information in the loan application to determine the sales price and appraised value it uses to calculate the LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios.
DU uses the amounts entered in the following data ﬁelds in the online loan application:
Sales price = Line A + Line B + Line C (in Section L4)
Line A = Sales Contract Price (the sales price for purchase transactions, or the cost of construction for construction transactions).
Line B = Improvements, Renovations, and Repairs (the cost of these items for HomeStyle Renovation transactions).
Line C = Land Value (For certain construction or manufactured home transactions the cost or value of the land if the borrower acquired the lot separately).
Appraised value = Appraised Property Value (in Section 4a)
Note: If the Appraised Property Value is not present, DU will use the Estimated Property Value. The Appraised Property Value must be entered (when available) and the loan caseﬁle must be resubmitted.

Introduction This topic contains information on CLTV ratios, including:
Calculation of the CLTV Ratio Loan-Level Price Adjustments
Calculation of the CLTV Ratio
For ﬁrst mortgage loans that are subject to subordinate ﬁnancing, the lender must calculate the LTV ratio and the CLTV ratio. For ﬁrst mortgage loans that are subject to a HELOC, see B2-1.2-03, Home Equity Combined Loan-to-Value (HCLTV) Ratios. For all other subordinate liens, see B2-1.2-04, Subordinate Financing for additional information.
The CLTV ratio is determined by dividing the sum of the items listed below by the lesser of the sales price or the appraised value of the property.

principal once the loan is closed.)
Note: For each subordinate liability, in order for the lender to accurately calculate the CLTV ratio for eligibility and underwriting purposes, the lender must determine the drawn portion of all HELOCs, if applicable, and the unpaid principal balance for all closed-end subordinate ﬁnancing. If any subordinate ﬁnancing is not shown on a credit report, the lender must obtain documentation from the borrower or creditor.
If the borrower discloses, or the lender discovers, new (or increased) subordinate ﬁnancing after the underwriting decision has been made, up to and concurrent with closing, the lender must re-underwrite the mortgage loan. (See B3-6-02, Debt-to-Income Ratios, for additional information.)
Note: The CLTV ratio calculation may diﬀer for certain mortgage loans. For details on these diﬀerences, see B2-1.3-05, Payoﬀ of Installment Land Contract Requirements; B5-2-03, Manufactured Housing Underwriting Requirements; B5-3.1-02, Conversion of Construction-to-Permanent Financing: Single-Closing Transactions; B5-3.2-03, HomeStyle Renovation Mortgages: Collateral Considerations; B5-3.3-01, HomeStyle Energy for Improvements on Existing Properties; B5-5.1-02, Community Seconds Loan Eligibility; and B5-5.2-02, Loans with Resale Restrictions: Eligibility, Collateral and Delivery Requirements; and B5-5.3-03, Shared Equity Transactions: Eligibility, Underwriting and Collateral Requirements.

Calculation of the HCLTV Ratio Permanently Modiﬁed HELOCs
Published February 5, 2025
165
Calculation of the HCLTV Ratio
For ﬁrst mortgages that have subordinate ﬁnancing under a HELOC, the lender must calculate the HCLTV ratio. This is determined by dividing the sum of the items listed below by the lesser of the sales price or appraised value of the property.
the original loan amount of the ﬁrst mortgage,
the full amount of any HELOCs (whether or not funds have been drawn), and
the unpaid principal balance (UPB) of all closed-end subordinate ﬁnancing.
Note: For each subordinate liability, in order for the lender to accurately calculate the HCLTV ratio for eligibility and underwriting purposes, the lender must determine the maximum credit line for all HELOCs, if applicable, and the unpaid principal balance for all closed-end subordinate ﬁnancing. If any subordinate ﬁnancing is not shown on a credit report, the lender must obtain documentation from the borrower or creditor. If the borrower discloses, or the lender discovers, new (or increased) subordinate ﬁnancing after the underwriting decision has been made, up to and concurrent with closing, the lender must re- underwrite the mortgage loan. (See B3-6-02, Debt-to-Income Ratios, for additional information.)
Permanently Modiﬁed HELOCs
If the lender determines the HELOC has been permanently modiﬁed and the outstanding UPB is less than the permanently modiﬁed HELOC, the lender must use the modiﬁed HELOC amount in calculating the HCLTV ratio for eligibility purposes and for delivery. The lender must obtain appropriate documentation that the HELOC has been permanently modiﬁed and include this documentation in the loan ﬁle.
If the outstanding UPB is greater than the permanently modiﬁed HELOC, the lender must use the outstanding UPB to calculate the HCLTV ratio for eligibility purposes and for delivery. As noted above, the lender must obtain appropriate documentation and include that documentation in the loan ﬁle.
In no case may the CLTV ratio exceed the HCLTV ratio.
Note: The HCLTV ratio calculation may diﬀer for certain mortgage loans. For details on these diﬀerences, see B2-1.3-05, Payoﬀ of Installment Land Contract Requirements; B5-2-03, Manufactured Housing Underwriting Requirements; B5-3.1-02, Conversion of Construction-to-Permanent Financing: Single-Closing Transactions; B5-3.3-01, HomeStyle Energy for Improvements on Existing Properties; B5-3.2-03, HomeStyle Renovation Mortgages: Collateral Considerations; and B5-5.1-02, Community Seconds Loan Eligibility.

Subordinate Financing Requirements Acceptable Subordinate Financing Unacceptable Subordinate Financing Terms Eligible Variable Payment Terms for Subordinate Financing Eligible Repayment Terms for Employer Subordinate Financing Resubordination Requirements for Reﬁnance Transactions Deﬁning Reﬁnance Transactions Based on Subordinate Lien Payoﬀ
Subordinate Financing Requirements
Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes ﬁrst-lien loans where the secured property is subject to subordinate ﬁnancing, except for co-op share loans that are subject to subordinate ﬁnancing. (See B5-7-01, High LTV Reﬁnance Loan and Borrower Eligibility for exceptions to this policy.) Subordinate liens must be
evidenced by a promissory note; reﬂected in a recorded mortgage, deed of trust, or other security instrument; and clearly subordinate to Fannie Mae’s ﬁrst mortgage.
Lenders must disclose the existence of subordinate ﬁnancing and the subordinate ﬁnancing repayment terms to Fannie Mae, the appraiser, and the mortgage insurer.
Note: Unless it qualiﬁes as a Community Seconds loan, an agreement under which a borrower is obligated to pay a third-party (other than a co-owner of the subject property) a share in any appreciation in the value of the subject property is not permitted.
The lender must consider all subordinate liens secured by the subject property, regardless of the obligated party, when calculating CLTV and HCLTV ratios. This includes business loans, such as those provided by the Small Business Administration.
Except as described in Acceptable Subordinate Financing below or under Section B5-5.1, Community Seconds, no other type of recorded instrument documenting or securing the borrower's obligation to pay an amount in connection with funds advanced to the borrower in relation to the ﬁrst mortgage is permitted, unless those funds have been advanced to the borrower by a co-owner of the subject property. Regardless of whether it qualiﬁes as ﬁnancing, eligible subordinated or unsecured PACE structures are permitted in accordance with B5-3.4-01, Property Assessed Clean Energy Loans.
For more information on subordinate ﬁnancing originated in connection with the Section 502 Leveraged (Blended) Loan Program, see B6-1-05, Eligible RD-Guaranteed Mortgages.
Acceptable Subordinate Financing
Published February 5, 2025
167
The table below provides the requirements for acceptable subordinate ﬁnancing, other than an eligible Community Seconds loan.
✓
Acceptable Subordinate Financing
Variable payment mortgages that comply with the details below.
Mortgages with regular payments that cover at least the interest due so that negative amortization
does not occur.
Mortgages with deferred payments in connection with employer subordinate ﬁnancing (see below).
Mortgage terms that require interest at a market rate.
If the interest rate for ﬁnancing provided by the property seller is more than 2% below current standard rates for second mortgages, the subordinate ﬁnancing must be considered a sales concession and the subordinate ﬁnancing amount must be deducted from the sales price.
Unacceptable Subordinate Financing Terms
The table below describes examples of unacceptable subordinate ﬁnancing terms on ﬁnancing that does not qualify as an eligible Community Seconds mortgage.
✓
Unacceptable Subordinate Financing Terms
Mortgages with negative amortization (with the exception of employer subordinate ﬁnancing
that has deferred payments).
Subordinate ﬁnancing that does not fully amortize under a level monthly payment plan where
the maturity or balloon payment date is less than ﬁve years after the note date of the new
ﬁrst mortgage (with the exception of employer subordinate ﬁnancing that has deferred
payments).
Note: Fannie Mae will accept these subordinate ﬁnancing terms when the amount of the
subordinate debt is minimal relative to the borrower's ﬁnancial assets and/or credit proﬁle.
For additional information about applicable subordinate ﬁnancing policies, see the following topics:
B5-5.1-02, Community Seconds Loan Eligibility,
B4-2.3-04, Loan Eligibility for Co-op Share Loans, and
B5-7-01, High LTV Reﬁnance Loan and Borrower Eligibility.
Published February 5, 2025
168
Eligible Variable Payment Terms for Subordinate Financing
Fannie Mae permits variable payments for subordinate ﬁnancing that does not qualify as an eligible Community Seconds loan if the following provisions are met:
With the exception of HELOCs, when the repayment terms provide for a variable interest rate, the monthly payment must remain constant for each 12-month period over the term of the subordinate mortgage. (For HELOCs, the monthly payment does not have to remain constant.)
The monthly payments for all subordinate liens must cover at least the interest due so that negative amortization does not occur (with the exception of employer subordinate ﬁnancing that has deferred payments).
Eligible Repayment Terms for Employer Subordinate Financing
If the subordinate ﬁnancing is from the borrower’s employer, it does not have to require regular payments of either principal and interest or interest only. Employer subordinate ﬁnancing may be structured in any of the following ways:
fully amortizing level monthly payments,
deferred payments for some period before changing to fully amortizing level payments,
deferred payments over the entire term, or
forgiveness of the debt over time.
The ﬁnancing terms may provide for the employer to require full repayment of the debt if the borrower’s employment is terminated (either voluntarily or involuntarily) before the maturity date of the subordinate ﬁnancing.
Refer to B3-4.3-08, Employer Assistance, for additional information.
Resubordination Requirements for Reﬁnance Transactions
If subordinate ﬁnancing is left in place in connection with a ﬁrst mortgage reﬁnance transaction, Fannie Mae requires execution and recordation of a resubordination agreement.
If state law permits subordinate ﬁnancing to remain in the same subordinate lien position established with the prior ﬁrst mortgage that is being reﬁnanced, Fannie Mae does not require resubordination. The subordinate lien must satisfy any speciﬁed criteria of the applicable statutes.
Note: Title insurance against the fact that a former subordinate lien is not properly resubordinated to the reﬁnance loan does not release lenders from compliance with these resubordination requirements, or from Fannie Mae’s requirement that the property is free and clear of all encumbrances and liens having priority over Fannie Mae’s loan.

A purchase money transaction is one in which the proceeds are used to ﬁnance the acquisition of a property or to ﬁnance the acquisition and rehabilitation of a property. The table below provides the general requirements for purchase money mortgage transactions. Certain mortgage loans and products may have diﬀerent eligibility requirements for purchase mortgage transactions. If applicable, the diﬀerences will be stated in the speciﬁc mortgage loan or product topic section.

General Requirements
Proceeds from the transaction may not be used to give the borrower cash back other than the
following:
an amount representing reimbursement for the borrower’s overpayment of fees and
charges, including refunds that may be required in accordance with certain federal laws or
regulations. The settlement statement must clearly indicate the refund, and the loan ﬁle must
include documentation to support the amount and reason for the refund; and
a legitimate pro-rated real estate tax credit in locales where real estate taxes are paid in
arrears.
Note: If the borrower receives cash back for a permissible purpose as listed above, the lender
must conﬁrm that the minimum borrower contribution requirements associated with the
selected mortgage product, if any, have been met. Reimbursements or refunds permitted
above may also be applied as a principal curtailment in accordance with B2-1.5-05, Principal
Curtailments. A pro-rated real estate tax credit is not an interested party contribution, and it
cannot be considered when determining if the borrower has suﬃcient assets for the
transaction.

Non-Arm's Length Transactions
Non-arm's length transactions are purchase transactions in which there is a relationship or business aﬃliation between the seller and the buyer of the property. Fannie Mae allows non-arm’s length transactions for the purchase of existing properties unless speciﬁcally forbidden for the particular scenario, such as delayed ﬁnancing. For the purchase of newly constructed properties, if the borrower has a relationship or business aﬃliation (any ownership interest, or employment) with the builder, developer, or seller of the property, Fannie Mae will only purchase mortgage loans secured by a principal residence. Fannie Mae will not purchase mortgage loans on newly constructed homes secured by a second home or investment property if the borrower has a relationship or business aﬃliation with the builder, developer, or seller of the property.

The following requirements apply:
The borrower (buyer) must be provided with written details of the additional fees, assessments, or payments and the additional necessary funds to complete the transaction must be documented.
The servicer that is agreeing to the preforeclosure or short sale must be provided with written details of the fees, assessments, or payments and has the option of renegotiating the payoﬀ amount to release its lien.
All parties (buyer, seller, and servicer) must provide their written agreement of the ﬁnal details of the transaction which must include the additional fees, assessments, or payments. This can be accomplished by using the Request for Approval of Short Sale or Alternative Request for the Approval of Short Sale forms published by the U.S. Treasury or any alternative form or addendum.
The settlement statement must include all fees, assessments, and payments included in the transaction.

pay oﬀ an existing ﬁrst mortgage (including an existing HELOC in ﬁrst-lien position);
pay oﬀ an existing construction loan and documented construction cost overruns that were incurred outside of the interim construction ﬁnancing for two-closing construction-to-permanent loans. (These construction cost overruns must be paid directly to the builder at closing.);
pay for construction costs to build the home for single-closing construction-to-permanent loans, which may include paying oﬀ an existing lot lien; or
pay oﬀ an installment land contract that was executed more than 12 months before the date of the loan application.
At least one borrower on the new loan must be an owner (on title) of the subject property at the time of the initial application. Exceptions are allowed if the lender documents that
the borrower acquired the property through an inheritance or was legally awarded the property (such as through a divorce, separation, or dissolution of a domestic partnership); or the property was previously owned by an inter vivos revocable trust and the borrower is the primary beneﬁciary of the trust; the borrower is currently ﬁnancially obligated on the loan being paid oﬀ but not on the title. This includes loans where the property is currently owned by a limited liability corporation (LLC) that is majority owned or controlled by the borrower(s). Ownership must be transferred into the name of the individual borrower(s). See B2-2-01, General Borrower Eligibility Requirements for additional requirements; or the borrower is paying oﬀ an installment land contract that was executed more than 12 months before the date of the loan application.
Only subordinate liens used to purchase the property may be paid oﬀ and included in the new mortgage. Exceptions are allowed for paying oﬀ a Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) loan or other debt (secured or unsecured) that was used solely for energy-related improvements. See B5-3.3-01, HomeStyle Energy for Improvements on Existing Properties, for additional information.
If the subject property was previously listed for sale, it must have been taken oﬀ the market on or before the disbursement date of the new loan.

Note: The above requirements do not apply to HomeReady or high LTV reﬁnance loans. For additional information, see B5-6-01, HomeReady Mortgage Loan and Borrower Eligibility or B5-7-01, High LTV Reﬁnance Loan and Borrower Eligibility accordingly.
Ineligible Transactions
When the following conditions exist, the transaction is ineligible as a limited cash-out reﬁnance and must be treated as a cash-out reﬁnance:
no outstanding ﬁrst lien on the subject property (except for single-closing construction-to-permanent transactions, which are eligible as a limited cash-out out reﬁnance even though there is not an outstanding lien on the subject property);
the proceeds are used to pay oﬀ a subordinate lien that was not used to purchase the property (other than the exceptions for paying oﬀ PACE loans and other debt used for energy-related improvements, described above);
the borrower ﬁnances the payment of real estate taxes that are more than 60 days delinquent for the subject property in the loan amount; and
a short-term reﬁnance mortgage loan that combines a ﬁrst mortgage and a non-purchase-money subordinate mortgage into a new ﬁrst mortgage or any reﬁnance of that loan within six months.
See also B2-1.3-04, Prohibited Reﬁnancing Practices.
Acceptable Uses
The following are acceptable in conjunction with a limited cash-out reﬁnance transaction:
modifying the interest rate and/or term for existing mortgages;
paying oﬀ the existing ﬁrst mortgage (which may include additional amounts required to pay oﬀ the loan, such as prepayment penalties, a deferred balance resulting from completion of a prior loss mitigation solution, and late fees);
paying for construction costs to build a home for a single-closing construction-to-permanent transaction, which may include paying oﬀ an existing lot lien;
paying oﬀ the construction loan and documented construction cost overruns for a two-closing construction-to-permanent loan;
paying oﬀ the installment land contract that was executed more than 12 months before the date of the loan application;
Published February 5, 2025
177
ﬁnancing the payment of closing costs, points, and prepaid items. With the exception of real estate taxes that are more than 60 days delinquent the borrower can include real estate taxes in the new loan amount provided
the real estate taxes must be paid in full through the transaction, and
payment for the taxes must be disbursed to the taxing authority through the closing transaction, with no funds used for the taxes disbursed to the borrower;
receiving cash back in an amount that is not more than the lesser of 2% of the new reﬁnance loan amount or $2,000;
buying out a co-owner pursuant to an agreement;
paying oﬀ a subordinate mortgage lien (including prepayment penalties) used to purchase the subject property. (When the subordinate loan is a Community Seconds, payoﬀ may include any required payment of the share of appreciation due to the Community Seconds provider under the terms of the shared appreciation agreement.)The lender must document that the entire amount of the subordinate ﬁnancing was used to acquire the property; or
paying oﬀ the unpaid principal balance of PACE loans and other debt used for energy-related improvements, described above.
Cash Back to the Borrower
As noted above, the borrower may receive a small amount of cash back in a limited cash-out reﬁnance transaction. The lender may also refund the borrower for the overpayment of fees and charges due to federal or state laws or regulations. Refunds such as these are not included in the maximum cash back limitation, provided that
the settlement statement clearly identiﬁes the refund, and
the loan ﬁle includes documentation to support the amount and reason for the refund.
This applies to standard limited cash-out reﬁnance transactions. For high LTV reﬁnance transactions, see B5-7-01, High LTV Reﬁnance Loan and Borrower Eligibility.
Note: These refunds may also be applied as a principal balance curtailment in accordance with B2-1.5-05, Principal Curtailments.
Documentation Requirements
To treat a transaction as a limited cash-out reﬁnance transaction, the lender must document that all proceeds of the existing subordinate lien were used to fund part of the subject property purchase price or pay for permissible energy-related expenses. Written conﬁrmation must be maintained in the mortgage ﬁle.
The following are acceptable forms of documentation:
a copy of the settlement statement for the purchase of the property;
a copy of the title policy from the purchase transaction that identiﬁes the subordinate ﬁnancing;
Published February 5, 2025
178
other documentation from the purchase transaction that indicates that a subordinate lien was used to purchase the subject property; or
for energy-related expenses, copies of invoices or receipts to evidence funds were used for energy improvements. A copy of an energy report is required in many cases. See B5-3.3-01, HomeStyle Energy for Improvements on Existing Properties, for additional information.
Existing Subordinate Liens That Will Not Be Paid Oﬀ
When a new limited cash-out reﬁnance transaction will not satisfy existing subordinate liens, the existing liens must be clearly subordinate to the new reﬁnance mortgage. The reﬁnance mortgage must meet Fannie Mae’s eligibility criteria for mortgages that are subject to subordinate ﬁnancing.
New Subordinate Financing
When a borrower obtains new subordinate ﬁnancing with the reﬁnancing of a ﬁrst mortgage loan, Fannie Mae treats the transaction as a limited cash-out reﬁnance provided the ﬁrst mortgage loan meets the eligibility criteria for a limited cash-out reﬁnance transaction.
Note: It is acceptable for borrowers to obtain cash from the proceeds of the new subordinate mortgage.
Reﬁnances to Buy Out An Owner’s Interest
A transaction that requires one owner to buy out the interest of another owner (for example, as a result of a divorce settlement or dissolution of a domestic partnership) is considered a limited cash-out reﬁnance if the secured property was jointly owned for at least 12 months preceding the disbursement date of the new mortgage loan.
All parties must sign a written agreement that states the terms of the property transfer and the proposed disposition of the proceeds from the reﬁnance transaction. Except in the case of recent inheritance of the subject property, documentation must be provided to indicate that the security property was jointly owned by all parties for at least 12 months preceding the disbursement date of the new mortgage loan.
Borrowers who acquire sole ownership of the property may not receive any of the proceeds from the reﬁnancing. The party buying out the other party’s interest must be able to qualify for the mortgage pursuant to Fannie Mae’s underwriting guidelines.
Exceptions to Limited Cash-Out Reﬁnance Requirements for High Loan-to-Value Reﬁnance Loans
See Chapter B5-7: High Loan-to-Value Reﬁnance Option, for modiﬁcations to the standard limited cash-out reﬁnance requirements for high LTV loan transactions.

Introduction This topic contains information on cash-out reﬁnance transactions, including:
Eligibility Requirements Ownership of the Property Ineligible Transactions Acceptable Uses Delayed Financing Exception Student Loan Cash-Out Reﬁnances Loan-Level Price Adjustments
Eligibility Requirements
The following requirements apply to cash-out reﬁnance transactions:
The transaction must be used to pay oﬀ existing mortgage loans by obtaining a new ﬁrst mortgage secured by the same property, or be a new mortgage on a property that does not have a mortgage lien against it (the borrower owns the property free and clear at the time of reﬁnance).
Published February 5, 2025
180
If an existing ﬁrst mortgage is being paid oﬀ through the transaction, it must be at least 12 months old at the time of reﬁnance, as measured by the note date of the existing loan to the note date of the new loan. This requirement does not apply
to any existing subordinate liens being paid oﬀ through the transaction, or
when buying out a co-owner pursuant to a legal agreement.
At least one borrower must have been on title for at least for six months prior to the disbursement date of the new loan. See Ownership of the Property below for exceptions.
For DU loan caseﬁles, if the DTI ratio exceeds 45%, six months reserves is required.
Properties that were listed for sale must have been taken oﬀ the market on or before the disbursement date of the new mortgage loan.
For the maximum allowable LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios and credit score requirements for manually underwritten cash-out reﬁnance loans, see the Eligibility Matrix.
See Cash-Out Reﬁnance Transactions in B5-2-03, Manufactured Housing Underwriting Requirements for additional information.
Ownership of the Property
At least one borrower must have been on title to the subject property for at least six months prior to the disbursement date of the new loan, unless one of the following exceptions apply:
There is no waiting period if the lender documents that the borrower acquired the property through an inheritance or was legally awarded the property (divorce, separation, or dissolution of a domestic partnership).
The delayed ﬁnancing requirements are met. See Delayed Financing Exception below.
If the property was owned prior to closing by a limited liability corporation (LLC) that is majority-owned or controlled by the borrower(s), the time it was held by the LLC may be counted towards meeting the borrower’s six-month ownership requirement. (In order to close the reﬁnance transaction, ownership must be transferred out of the LLC and into the name of the individual borrower(s). See B2-2-01, General Borrower Eligibility Requirements for additional details.)
If the property was owned prior to closing by an inter vivos revocable trust, the time held by the trust may be counted towards meeting the borrower’s six-month ownership requirement if the borrower is the primary beneﬁciary of the trust.
The above ownership policy applies in addition to the requirement that an existing ﬁrst mortgage being paid oﬀ through the reﬁnance is at least 12 months old.
Ineligible Transactions
The following transaction types are not eligible as cash-out reﬁnances:
The mortgage loan is subject to a temporary interest rate buydown.
Published February 5, 2025
181
For certain transactions on properties that have a Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) loan, borrowers who reﬁnance the ﬁrst mortgage loan and have suﬃcient equity to pay oﬀ the PACE loan but choose not to do so will be ineligible for a cash-out reﬁnance. See B5-3.4-01, Property Assessed Clean Energy Loans for additional information.
Transactions classiﬁed as HomeStyle Energy loans. However, energy-related improvements are permitted.
Transactions in which a portion of the proceeds of the reﬁnance is used to pay oﬀ the outstanding balance on an installment land contract, regardless of the date the installment land contract was executed.
The new loan amount includes the ﬁnancing of real estate taxes that are more than 60 days delinquent and an escrow account is not established, unless requiring an escrow account is not permitted by applicable law or regulation. For example, if a particular state law does not allow a lender to require an escrow account under certain circumstances, the loan would be eligible for sale to Fannie Mae without an escrow account.
See also B2-1.3-04, Prohibited Reﬁnancing Practices.
Acceptable Uses
The following are acceptable uses for cash-out reﬁnance transactions:
paying oﬀ the UPB of the existing ﬁrst mortgage (provided the existing ﬁrst mortgage is at least 12 months old);
ﬁnancing the payment of closing costs, points, and prepaid items. The borrower can include real estate taxes in the new loan amount. Delinquent real estate taxes (taxes past due by more than 60 days) can also be included in the new loan amount, but if they are, an escrow account must be established, subject to applicable law or regulation;
paying oﬀ any outstanding subordinate mortgage liens of any age;
taking equity out of the subject property that may be used for any purpose;
ﬁnancing a short-term reﬁnance mortgage loan that combines a ﬁrst mortgage and a non-purchase- money subordinate mortgage into a new ﬁrst mortgage.
Delayed Financing Exception
Borrowers who purchased the subject property within the past six months (measured from the date on which the property was purchased to the disbursement date of the new mortgage loan) are eligible for a cash-out reﬁnance if all of the following requirements are met.
✓
Requirements for a Delayed Financing Exception
The original purchase transaction was an arms-length transaction.
Published February 5, 2025
182
✓
Requirements for a Delayed Financing Exception
For this reﬁnance transaction, the borrower(s) must meet Fannie Mae’s borrower eligibility
requirements as described in B2-2-01, General Borrower Eligibility Requirements. The
borrower(s) may have initially purchased the property as one of the following:
a natural person;
an eligible inter vivos revocable trust, when the borrower is both the individual establishing
the trust and the beneﬁciary of the trust;
an eligible land trust when the borrower is the beneﬁciary of the land trust; or
an LLC or partnership in which the borrower(s) have an individual or joint ownership of 100%.
The original purchase transaction is documented by a settlement statement, which conﬁrms that
no mortgage ﬁnancing was used to obtain the subject property. (A recorded trustee's deed (or
similar alternative) conﬁrming the amount paid by the grantee to trustee may be substituted for
a settlement statement if a settlement statement was not provided to the purchaser at time of
sale.)
The preliminary title search or report must conﬁrm that there are no existing liens on the subject
property.
The sources of funds for the purchase transaction are documented (such as bank statements,
personal loan documents, or a HELOC on another property).
If the source of funds used to acquire the property was an unsecured loan or a loan secured by
an asset other than the subject property (such as a HELOC secured by another property), the
settlement statement for the reﬁnance transaction must reﬂect that all cash-out proceeds be
used to pay oﬀ or pay down, as applicable, the loan used to purchase the property. Any
payments on the balance remaining from the original loan must be included in the debt-to-
income ratio calculation for the reﬁnance transaction.
Note: Funds received as gifts and used to purchase the property may not be reimbursed with
proceeds of the new mortgage loan.
The new loan amount can be no more than the actual documented amount of the borrower's
initial investment in purchasing the property plus the ﬁnancing of closing costs, prepaid fees,
and points on the new mortgage loan (subject to the maximum LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios for
the cash-out transaction based on the current appraised value).
All other cash-out reﬁnance eligibility requirements are met. Cash-out pricing is applicable.
Student Loan Cash-Out Reﬁnances
Published February 5, 2025

The student loan cash-out reﬁnance feature allows for the payoﬀ of student loan debt through the reﬁnance transaction with a waiver of the cash-out reﬁnance LLPA if all of the following requirements are met:
✓
Requirements for Student Loan Cash-out Reﬁnances
The loan must be underwritten in DU. DU cannot speciﬁcally identify these transactions, but will
issue a message when it appears that only subject property liens and student loans are marked
paid by closing. The message will remind lenders about certain requirements below; however,
the lender must conﬁrm the loan meets all of the requirements outside of DU.
The standard cash-out reﬁnance LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios apply per the Eligibility Matrix.
At least one student loan must be paid oﬀ with proceeds from the subject transaction with the
following criteria:
proceeds must be paid directly to the student loan servicer at closing;
at least one borrower must be obligated on the student loan(s) being paid oﬀ, and
the student loan must be paid in full - partial payments are not permitted.
The transaction may also be used to pay oﬀ one of the following:
an existing ﬁrst mortgage loan (including an existing HELOC in ﬁrst-lien position); or
a single-closing construction-to-permanent loan to pay for construction costs to build the
home, which may include paying oﬀ an existing lot lien.
Only subordinate liens used to purchase the property may be paid oﬀ and included in the new
mortgage. Exceptions are allowed for paying oﬀ a PACE loan or other debt (secured or
unsecured) that was used solely for energy improvements (see B5-3.4-01, Property Assessed
Clean Energy Loans and B5-3.3-01, HomeStyle Energy for Improvements on Existing Properties
for additional information).
The transaction may be used to ﬁnance the payment of closing costs, points, and prepaid items.
With the exception of real estate taxes that are more than 60 days delinquent, the borrower can
include real estate taxes in the new loan amount as long as an escrow account is established,
subject to applicable law or regulation.
The borrower may receive cash back in an amount that is not more than the lesser of 2% of the
new reﬁnance loan amount or $2,000. The lender may also refund the borrower for the
overpayment of fees and charges due to federal or state laws or regulations, or apply a principal
curtailment (see B2-1.3-02, Limited Cash-Out Reﬁnance Transactions for additional information).
Unless otherwise stated, all other standard cash-out reﬁnance requirements apply.
Published February 5, 2025

Delivery Requirements
Loans qualiﬁed as student loan cash-out reﬁnances must be delivered to Fannie Mae with Special Feature Code (SFC) 003 and SFC 841.
Loan-Level Price Adjustments
An LLPA applies to certain cash-out reﬁnance transactions based on the LTV ratio and credit score. These LLPAs are in addition to any other price adjustments that are otherwise applicable to the particular transaction. See the Loan-Level Price Adjustment (LLPA) Matrix.
As noted above, the LLPA is waived for loans that meet the student loan cash-out reﬁnance requirements.

Introduction This topic contains information on prohibited reﬁnancing practices, including:
Lender Solicitation for Reﬁnancing Prearranged Reﬁnancing Agreements Agreements to Advance Borrower Payments Conditional Tenders of Payment
Lender Solicitation for Reﬁnancing
Sellers/servicers may not:
Published February 5, 2025
185
speciﬁcally target Fannie Mae borrowers for oﬀers to reﬁnance;
treat loans they hold in their own portfolios and those sold to another investor or Fannie Mae as separate classes of loans for purposes of promoting reﬁnancing.
Sellers/servicers may not, as a means of making a loan eligible for repurchase from an MBS pool (for future reﬁnancing), encourage a borrower to refrain from making loan payments.
Prearranged Reﬁnancing Agreements
Sellers/servicers may not deliver a loan to Fannie Mae that is in the process of being reﬁnanced. Fannie Mae considers the delivery of a seasoned loan that is in the process of being reﬁnanced as a form of targeting, and is therefore unacceptable, even if no agreement for future reﬁnancing was entered into at the time of origination. The seller/servicer must have in place procedures to ensure that it does not deliver to Fannie Mae any loan that it is in the process of reﬁnancing or acquiring from, or funding for, a third-party originator.
Similarly, a seller/servicer may not deliver a loan to Fannie Mae if the seller/servicer (or any aﬃliate or third- party originator) and the borrower have entered into an arrangement:
for special terms (such as reduced fees) for a future reﬁnance of the loan - unless the seller/servicer obtains a negotiated contract from Fannie Mae that allows delivery of the loan in spite of its shortened prepayment expectation. If the seller/servicer believes that there might be such a reﬁnance agreement, the seller/servicer should contact its Fannie Mae customer account team to determine whether the loan is eligible for delivery. to complete a reﬁnance transaction that circumvents Fannie Mae's cash-out reﬁnance policies and pricing. A transaction is not eligible as a limited cash-out reﬁnance if the borrower completed a cash-out reﬁnance transaction with a note date 30 days or less prior to the application date of a new reﬁnance secured by the same property.
Agreements to Advance Borrower Payments
Reﬁnancing arrangements that call for the seller/servicer to advance a number of payments on the borrower’s behalf and then to reﬁnance the mortgage once the agreed-upon payments have been advanced are not permitted.
Fannie Mae also restricts reﬁnancing practices that aﬀect prepayment patterns. Fannie Mae analyzes MBS pools that have high levels of prepayments. If such analysis raises concerns about a seller/servicer’s practices, Fannie Mae may review the seller/servicer’s origination and reﬁnancing activities to ensure compliance with our requirements. With respect to any mortgage loan that pays oﬀ within 120 days from the whole loan purchase date or the MBS issue date, Fannie Mae in its sole discretion may require reimbursements by the seller/servicer for any premium paid or buyup proceeds paid in connection with the purchase of the mortgage loan. (For mortgage loans repurchased by a seller/servicer, Fannie Mae may require reimbursement in its sole discretion, without regard to the 120-day limitation.) See C1-1-01, Execution Options and C3-3-02, Accessing Buyup and Buydown Ratios and Calculating Payments or Charges for speciﬁc requirements.
Conditional Tenders of Payment
Published February 5, 2025
186
Conditional tenders of payment are not an acceptable alternative to reﬁnancing for Fannie Mae loans, regardless of whether they relate to a loan being serviced for Fannie Mae or to a loan that is being delivered to it. Fannie Mae does not consider a reﬁnancing to have occurred unless the mortgage debt is satisﬁed and the lien against the property is released. The only exceptions to this are
negotiated transactions involving seasoned loans held in a seller/servicer’s portfolio that have been modiﬁed since they were originated; and
transactions involving loans secured by properties in New York that are originated under the statutory provisions that permit reﬁnanced loan to be documented by a consolidation, extension, and modiﬁcation agreement.
If the transaction that permits the reﬁnance to be documented by a consolidation, extension and modiﬁcation agreement is related to an eMortgage, the seller/servicer must follow the applicable procedures in the Servicing Guide.
The seller/servicer must not
use conditional tenders of payment as a reﬁnancing alternative, or
honor requests it receives for conditional tenders of payment for any loan that it services for Fannie Mae.
The seller/servicer that oﬀers conditional tenders of payment as a reﬁnancing alternative must not deliver any reﬁnanced loan to Fannie Mae unless it is documented by a new note and a new loan, unless it is one of the previously mentioned authorized exceptions.
If Fannie Mae’s post-purchase underwriting performance review of a reﬁnanced loan reveals that the conditional tender of payment procedure was used as an alternative to reﬁnancing the loan, Fannie Mae will require the seller/servicer to repurchase the loan in question and, if multiple occurrences of this practice are identiﬁed, Fannie Mae may take other appropriate action against the seller/servicer.

B2-1.3-05, Payoﬀ of Installment Land Contract Requirements
(12/11/2024)
Introduction This topic contains requirements for the payoﬀ of installment land contracts.
Payoﬀ of Installment Land Contract Requirements
Payoﬀ of Installment Land Contract Requirements
When the proceeds of a mortgage loan are used to pay oﬀ the outstanding balance on an installment land contract (also known as contract or bond for deed) that was executed within the 12 months preceding the date of the loan application, Fannie Mae will consider the mortgage loan to be a purchase money mortgage loan.
The LTV ratio for the mortgage loan must be determined by dividing the new loan amount by the lesser of the total acquisition cost (deﬁned as the purchase price indicated in the land contract, plus any costs the purchaser incurs for rehabilitation, renovation, or energy conservation improvements) or the appraised value of the property at the time the new mortgage loan is closed. The expenditures included in the total acquisition cost must be fully documented by the borrower.
When the installment land contract was executed more than 12 months before the date of the loan application, Fannie Mae will consider the loan to be a limited cash-out reﬁnance in accordance with B2-1.3-02, Limited Cash- Out Reﬁnance Transactions. In this case, the LTV ratio for the mortgage loan must be determined by dividing the new loan amount by the appraised value of the property at the time the new mortgage loan is closed.
Cash-out reﬁnance transactions involving installment land contracts are not eligible for delivery.

Fixed-Rate Loan Eligibility
Fixed-Rate Loan Eligibility
Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes conventional, fully amortizing, ﬁxed-rate ﬁrst mortgage loans. Conventional ﬁxed-rate loans are not assumable as of the note date. When selling such loans to Fannie Mae, the Assumption Indicator in the Loan Delivery application must be "False" (which means not assumable).
The payments must be structured as follows:
level monthly installments of principal and interest (P&I),
due on the ﬁrst day of each month, and
payment of interest in arrears.
The loan can be subject to a temporary interest rate buydown plan, provided that the subject property is secured by a principal residence or a second home. See B2-1.4-04, Temporary Interest Rate Buydowns for additional information.

Overview
Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes fully amortizing ARMs that are originated under its standard or negotiated plans. For maximum LTV/CLTV/HCLTV ratios and credit score requirements for ARMs, see the Eligibility Matrix.
Acceptable ARM Characteristics
The following table describes standard conventional Fannie Mae ARM requirements.
✓
Standard Conventional ARM Requirements
Fannie Mae does not set a minimum remaining term requirement at the time of loan
purchase.
Published February 5, 2025
190
✓
Standard Conventional ARM Requirements
The initial adjustment period in months must align with the initial ﬁxed-rate period in years.
For example, a "3-year ARM" must have an initial ﬁxed period of 36 months, and a "5-year
ARM" must be 60 months.
Each ARM plan must oﬀer lifetime and per-adjustment interest rate change limitations.
Lifetime interest rate change limitations apply to interest rate increases only.
Per-adjustment interest rate change limitations apply to interest rate increases and
decreases.
Mortgage interest rates may never decrease to less than the ARM’s margin, regardless of any
downward interest rate cap.
Fannie Mae restricts purchase or securitization of seasoned ARMs to those that are delivered
as negotiated transactions.
ARMs and Temporary Interest Rate Buydowns
The following table provides parameters pertaining to ARMs subject to temporary interest rate buydowns.
✓
ARMs Subject to Interest Rate Buydowns
Must be secured by a principal residence or second home.
Are only permitted with an ARM plan that has an initial interest rate period of three years or
more.
ARM plans that have an initial interest rate period of three years (Plan 4926) must be secured
by a one- or two-unit property and must be structured as a 2-1 buydown with a buydown
period no greater than 24 months.
ARM plans with an initial interest rate period greater than three years (Plans 4927, 4928, and
4929) can be structured as either 3-2-1 or 2-1 buydowns (or other allowable structures per
B2-1.4-04, Temporary Interest Rate Buydowns).
ARM Plan Indexes
A Fannie Mae ARM plan must be tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Index. SOFR is a broad
Published February 5, 2025
191
measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U. S. Treasury securities in the repurchase agreement (repo) market. Fannie Mae uses a 30-day average of the SOFR index as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Standard Conventional ARM Plans
To qualify as a Fannie Mae standard conventional ARM, the ARM must have all of the characteristics speciﬁed in the Standard ARM Plan Matrix for the speciﬁc ARM plan.
The Standard ARM Plan Matrix is available on Fannie Mae's website and is incorporated by reference into this Guide.
Initial Note Rate Limitations
Fannie Mae limits the initial note rate for ARMs with initial interest rate periods of less than ﬁve years.
The limitation requires comparison of the initial note rate to the fully indexed rate that is applicable at the time the loan is originated.
Calculating the Fully Indexed Rate
The fully indexed rate is the sum of the value of the applicable index and the mortgage margin, which is then rounded to the nearest one-eighth percent.
Note: Unless speciﬁc product terms provide otherwise, if the index plus gross margin equals a number that is equidistant between the higher and lower one-eighth percent, Fannie Mae rounds down to the nearest one-eighth percent.
The applicable index value that determines the fully indexed rate is any index value in eﬀect during the 90 days that precede the note date.
Determining ARM Acceptability
Lenders must determine whether an ARM loan is acceptable for purchase by Fannie Mae by subtracting the initial note rate of the loan from the fully indexed rate in eﬀect when the loan was originated. The diﬀerence must not exceed 3%.
Mortgage Margin
The mortgage margin is the “spread” that is added to the index value to develop the interest accrual rate for the mortgage. The maximum mortgage margin may be no more than 300 basis points.
When lenders oﬀer a deeply discounted “teaser” rate for the mortgage, the margin is generally not used in determining the initial interest rate, but will be used to determine the interest rate for all future interest rate
Published February 5, 2025
192
changes.
Interest Accrual Rate Calculation
ARM instruments provide for each new interest accrual rate to be calculated by adding the mortgage margin to the most recent index ﬁgure available 45 days before the interest change date. Fannie Mae uniform instruments for all standard ARM plans provide for rounding to the nearest one-eighth.
Note: If a mortgage instrument provides otherwise, lenders must check with their Fannie Mae customer account team as there may be pooling and/or disclosure impact.
Interest rate calculations are subject to the applicable per-adjustment and lifetime interest rate change limitations.
ARMs and MBS Pools
MBS pools cannot contain ARMs with provisions that allow or require the lender or servicer to change the minimum or maximum interest rate or the mortgage margin following an assumption, unless those provisions are waived prior to pooling such mortgage loans. Since this is not a feature contained in standard Fannie Mae ARM instruments, the lender must check with its Fannie Mae customer account team to determine acceptability of the nonstandard form.
If such a unilateral waiver is legally precluded because the note provision would be beneﬁcial to the borrower and therefore requires borrower consent to waive, Fannie Mae will require evidence of a prior, duly written and executed bilateral waiver between the lender and the related borrower before allowing the loan to be pooled.
For more information on pooling ARMs, see Chapter C3-5, Pooling Loans into ARM MBS.
Pooling Standard Fannie Mae ARM Plans Without Special Disclosure
To be pooled as a standard Fannie Mae ARM plan without a special disclosure, the ARM must meet all of the standard plan characteristics and must
have a monthly payment that is due on the ﬁrst day of the month;
have an original maturity no longer than 30 years; and
be originated on the applicable Fannie Mae standard forms, with no modiﬁcations, which cover all other pooling requirements.
See the Standard ARM Plan Matrix for additional information.
ARM Disclosures
Lenders must provide borrowers with disclosures in compliance with all applicable laws.
Published February 5, 2025
193
Disclosures Regarding Availability of Index Values
In addition to any disclosures required by applicable law, lenders must inform borrowers that the movement in the index on which the mortgage interest rate is based can be monitored and where the value for the index can be obtained. A number of periodicals publish current index values. Lenders may refer borrowers to any of the periodicals.
Lenders should advise borrowers that an alternative published index will be selected (consistent with the provisions of the mortgage note) should the original index for a speciﬁc ARM plan no longer be available or published. This is commonly referred to as the “fallback” language in the note.
Fannie Mae relies on the following “oﬃcial” source for the index used for Fannie Mae ARM plans:
A 30-day average of the SOFR index as published daily by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Disclosures Regarding Below-Market Interest Rates
Lenders must notify borrowers of current index values and mortgage margins if the borrower’s initial interest rate is below-market.
Unless the lender is already required by regulation to make a comparable disclosure, the lender must show by example what the interest rate would be if the loan had been adjusted at the time of origination.
Lenders must ensure that borrowers are aware of, and prepared for, the possibility of both an interest rate increase and a payment increase on the ﬁrst interest rate adjustment date.
Disclosures Regarding Conversions
Disclosures regarding conversions must include the following:
✓
Requirement: Conversion Disclosures Must Include
The instances when the conversion option may be exercised.
The time frame within which conversion requests must be received.
The time frame within which the borrower must return executed conversion documents.
Any fees that will be charged for processing the conversion.
Note: Fannie Mae allows a $250 fee for ARM plans that have a monthly conversion option and
a $100 fee for other ARM plans.
Published February 5, 2025
194
✓
Requirement: Conversion Disclosures Must Include
Once the ARM plan converts to a ﬁxed-rate loan, the mortgage is no longer assumable.
Any other special conditions.
Disclosures Regarding Assumption of ARMs
Although Fannie Mae ARMs are usually assumable, some plans do restrict assumability.
When assumptions are restricted, the lender must advise the borrower of the exact nature of the restriction(s).
Note: Lenders must disclose to borrowers that any ARM plan that includes an option to convert to a ﬁxed-rate mortgage cannot be assumed once the conversion option is exercised.
See the Standard ARM Plan Matrix for information about the assumability provisions of Fannie Mae’s various ARM plans.
Requirements Regarding Interest Rate and Monthly Payment Adjustments
The following requirements apply to interest rate and monthly payment adjustments for ARM loans:
The loan being delivered must not be subject to any current litigation with respect to the manner in which the interest rate and/or payment adjustments were calculated or implemented.
The lender must not be servicing other ARMs that include interest rate and payment adjustment provisions similar to those of the mortgage being sold to Fannie Mae that are the subject of current litigation related to the manner in which adjustments were made.
ARM Payment Shock
ARMs that provide for low initial payments based on ﬁxed introductory rates that expire after a short period of time and then adjust to a variable rate for the remaining term of the mortgage loan have the potential for payment shock. “Payment shock” refers to the impact on the borrower’s ability to continue making the mortgage payments once the introductory rate expires. After the rate and payment increase, the borrower is subsequently faced with a large increase in monthly PITIA.
Lenders must limit the impact of any potential payment shock on an ARM with an initial ﬁxed-rate period of ﬁve years or less by qualifying borrowers based on the qualifying rate described in B3-6-04, Qualifying Payment Requirements.
DU Generic ARM Plans
Generic ARM plans are provided for loan caseﬁles underwritten through DU. These generic ARM plans are

Under “Market Rate” Post-Conversion Options Eligibility Requirements for Converted ARMs Delivery Requirements and Security Instruments for ARMs Converted to Fixed-Rate Mortgages Mortgage Documents for Fixed-Rate Conversion Option
General Information
Fannie Mae accepts delivery of ﬁxed-rate mortgages that were converted from ARMs either by a legally executed modiﬁcation agreement or under the provisions of the mortgage instrument.
Although the ARM does not have to have been originated on Fannie Mae uniform instruments or in accordance with Fannie Mae eligibility requirements for ARMs, the new ﬁxed-rate mortgage that results from the conversion must meet Fannie Mae’s general eligibility and underwriting requirements for newly originated ﬁxed-rate mortgages.
Converted ARMs Removed from ARM MBS Pools
This topic describes the circumstances under which a converted ARM that is removed from an ARM MBS pool as the result of its conversion to a ﬁxed-rate mortgages may be redelivered to Fannie Mae.
If the mortgage is more than 12 months old at the time of the redelivery, and the lender speciﬁed a “market rate” post-conversion disposition option when the MBS pool was delivered to Fannie Mae, the mortgage must meet the same eligibility criteria as other converted ARMs (as discussed in “Eligibility Requirements for Converted ARMs” later in this topic).
If the lender speciﬁed a take-out post-conversion disposition option when the MBS pool was delivered to Fannie Mae, the lender does not need to requalify the borrower or verify that the mortgage satisﬁes Fannie Mae eligibility criteria.
Borrower Requaliﬁcation Considerations for Fixed-Rate Mortgages Converted from ARMs and Redelivered Under “Market Rate” Post-Conversion Options
To qualify a borrower, lenders may use the original in-ﬁle documentation to evaluate the borrower’s ﬁnancial ability, as long as the borrower is able to qualify for the mortgage based on either of the following:
The mortgage interest rate in eﬀect following the conversion and Fannie Mae’s current underwriting guidelines for a conventional ﬁxed-rate mortgage, or
The mortgage interest rate in eﬀect for the ARM when it was originated and the underwriting guidelines Fannie Mae used for ARMs at that time.
If the lender is unable to qualify a borrower under the previous options, the lender must requalify the borrower under Fannie Mae’s standard guidelines, including
obtaining a new loan application,
Published February 5, 2025
198
obtaining up-to-date credit reports,
obtaining new employment and income veriﬁcations using the acceptable documentation,
evaluating the borrower’s ﬁnancial ability based on
the mortgage interest rate in eﬀect for the converted mortgage, and
Fannie Mae’s current underwriting guidelines for a conventional ﬁxed-rate mortgage.
Eligibility Requirements for Converted ARMs
The following speciﬁc eligibility requirements apply to converted ARMs that are delivered as either whole loans or MBS pool deliveries under the “market rate” post-conversion disposition option that were removed from an ARM MBS pool as the result of the conversion:
✓
Requirements
The ARM must have been at least 12 months old when the conversion occurred.
The converted mortgage must meet all of the eligibility criteria speciﬁed for mortgages that
are more than one year old, unless Fannie Mae has speciﬁed that those criteria do not apply.
Note: The age of the mortgage is calculated from the date the ARM was originated. These
speciﬁc eligibility criteria appear in B2-1.5-02, Loan Eligibility.
The mortgage loan must be current at the time of delivery.
Note: To minimize processing delays, Fannie Mae considers a mortgage current if no more
than 45 days have elapsed since the last paid installment date.
The total of all interest rate increases or payment adjustments (including any combination of
scheduled ARM interest rate changes and the increases scheduled under an interest rate
buydown plan) that occurred after the ARM was originated must not have exceeded 2% (for
the interest rate adjustment) or 15% (for the payment adjustment) if the lender qualiﬁes the
borrower on the basis of the mortgage interest rate that was in eﬀect for the ARM when it was
originated and the ARM underwriting guidelines Fannie Mae used at that time.
The modiﬁed mortgage must provide for a ﬁxed-interest rate, level monthly payments, and
amortization within the term of the original mortgage.
The title insurance policy or any endorsements to it are not impaired because of the option to
convert to a ﬁxed-rate mortgage or the actual conversion.
Published February 5, 2025
199
✓
Requirements
If the original title policy did not include the ARM endorsements currently required, the lender
must indemnify Fannie Mae (as described in A2-1-03, Indemniﬁcation for Losses) against
Fannie Mae losses that arise out of future title disputes related to the years in which the
mortgage was an ARM.
The original loan amount of the ARM did not exceed Fannie Mae's current maximum mortgage
amount limitation at the time Fannie Mae originally securitized the mortgage in an ARM MBS
pool.
The greater of the original mortgage amount (at origination of the ARM, pre-conversion) or the
current unpaid principal balance must be used to determine that the modiﬁed mortgage meets
Fannie Mae requirements for maximum mortgage amount, LTV ratios, mortgage insurance
coverage, and title insurance.
EXCEPTION: For the delivery of a converted ARM that Fannie Mae initially securitized in an ARM
MBS pool,
if Fannie Mae’s loan limits decreased between the time Fannie Mae initially securitized the
ARM and the time the converted mortgage is redelivered to Fannie Mae after it is removed
from the pool, the mortgage will still be acceptable to Fannie Mae even if the original
mortgage balance exceeds the maximum mortgage amount that is in eﬀect at the time of the
redelivery.
BACKGROUND
This recognizes and acknowledges, respectively, the fact that
the loan satisﬁed Fannie Mae requirements when it was securitized, and
the redelivery is a function of an administrative requirement Fannie Mae imposed for
mortgage-backed security transactions, rather than the delivery of a diﬀerent mortgage.
The LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios at the time of conversion must not exceed the maximum
allowable limits for ﬁxed-rate mortgages, see the Standard ARM Plan Matrix.
If the ARM had negatively amortized, the LTV ratio (and the CLTV ratio and the HCLTV ratio)
requirement must be satisﬁed as a result of
Subsequent normal amortization
The application of funds contributed by the borrower, or
An increase in the value of the property.
Note: Increase in property value must be supported by a current appraisal.
Delivery Requirements and Security Instruments for ARMs Converted to Fixed- Rate Mortgages
Lenders must identify each converted ARM that was repurchased from an MBS pool because the conversion to
Published February 5, 2025
200
ﬁxed-rate option was exercised and subsequently redelivered to Fannie Mae as a whole loan delivery of a ﬁxed- rate mortgage with SFC 036.
Lenders must include in the delivery package a Loan Modiﬁcation Agreement ( Form 3179 ) as evidence of the conversion to a ﬁxed-rate mortgage.
Note: A diﬀerent (but substantially equivalent) modiﬁcation agreement is also acceptable, as long as it includes an enforceable due-on-sale clause.
✓
Modiﬁcation Agreement Requirements
Lenders must determine whether a modiﬁcation agreement has to be recorded in each
particular jurisdiction in order to preserve the lien position of the mortgage.
If recordation is required, lenders must submit the recorded instrument when it delivers the
mortgage for purchase or securitization.
Lenders must obtain a title bring-down through the date of the recordation.
Mortgage Documents for Fixed-Rate Conversion Option
Execution of Fannie Mae’s standard riders or addenda that provide the terms for conversion to a ﬁxed-rate mortgage or any other conversion option instrument is not required if:
a convertibility provision was included in the adjustable-rate note, or
the lender previously agreed to a conversion modiﬁcation despite the fact that the loan documents did not give the borrower an option to convert. In this instance, lenders must provide a modiﬁcation agreement to document the conversion and obtain a title bring-down through the date of the recordation.
See Riders & Addenda for current standard riders or addenda.

Provisions for Temporary Interest Rate Buydown Plans
The table below provides the general requirements under which Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes loans subject to temporary interest rate buydown plans.
✓
General Requirements for Loans with Temporary Interest Rate Buydown Plans
Temporary interest rate buydowns are allowed on ﬁxed-rate mortgages and certain ARM plans
for principal residences or second homes provided the rate reduction does not exceed 3%,
and the rate increase will not exceed 1% per year.
The buydown plan must be a written agreement between the party providing the buydown
funds and the borrower.
All of the terms of the buydown plan must be disclosed to Fannie Mae, the mortgage insurer,
and the property appraiser.
The mortgage instruments must reﬂect the permanent payment terms rather than the terms
of the buydown plan. In no event may the buydown plan change the terms of the mortgage
note.
Buydown Funds Provided by Interested Parties to the Transaction
When the source of the buydown funds is an interested party to the property sale or purchase transaction, Fannie Mae’s interested-party contribution limits apply. (See B3-4.1-02, Interested Party Contributions (IPCs).)
Lender-Funded Buydowns
When the lender funds the buydown, the buydown agreement must require that the funds in the buydown
Published February 5, 2025
202
account be transferred to the new servicer if the mortgage is included as part of a subsequent transfer of servicing.
Buydown Agreements
The buydown agreement must provide that the borrower is not relieved of the obligation to make the mortgage payments required by the terms of the mortgage note if, for any reason, the buydown funds are not available.
The buydown agreement may include an option for the buydown funds to be returned to the borrower or to the lender, if it funded the buydown, if the mortgage is paid oﬀ before all of the funds have been applied.
A copy of the buydown agreement must be included in the delivery documentation for the mortgage.

Terms of the Buydown
Fannie Mae does not place a limit on the total dollar amount of an interest rate buydown.
The total dollar amount of an interest rate buydown must be consistent with the terms of the buydown period.
An interest rate buydown plan must provide for:
a buydown period not greater than 3 years, and
increases of not more than 1% in the portion of the interest rate paid by the borrower in each 1- year interval.
More frequent changes are permitted as long as the total annual increase does not exceed 1%.

been applied.
Buydown funds cannot be used to pay past-due payments.
Buydown funds cannot be used to reduce the mortgage amount for purposes of determining
the LTV ratio.
Disposing of Buydown Funds
If the mortgage is liquidated or the property is sold during the buydown period, the lender should dispose of the buydown funds in the following manner:

Introduction This topic contains information on loan limits, including:
Overview Loan Limits Deﬁned Loan Limits and Modiﬁed Loans
Overview
Fannie Mae can only purchase loans up to a certain dollar amount. This dollar amount is known as the conforming loan limit. Fannie Mae’s loan limits are imposed under its federal charter as amended by law.
The loan limits apply to all conventional loans delivered to Fannie Mae for whole loan purchase or MBS pool issuance and are based on the original loan amount of the loan (irrespective of the origination date). The limits are subject to change annually and vary, depending upon the number of units in the property and the property’s location. The conforming loan limits are posted on Fannie Mae's website.
Lenders are responsible for ensuring that the original loan amount of each loan does not exceed the applicable maximum loan limit for the speciﬁc area in which the property is located at the time the loan is delivered to Fannie Mae.
Published February 5, 2025
206
Loan Limits Deﬁned
Fannie Mae’s ﬁrst mortgage loan limits are deﬁned in terms of baseline (also known as "general") loan limits and high-cost area loan limits:
The baseline limits apply to the majority of the loans that Fannie Mae purchases.
The high-cost area loan limits apply to loans secured by properties in designated high-cost areas, as determined by Fannie Mae’s regulator. The high-cost area loan limits vary across the country.
High-balance loans are subject to the high-cost area loan limits. Fannie Mae’s eligibility and delivery requirements may vary for high-balance loans. See Chapter B5-1, High-Balance Mortgage Loans for additional information.
If the loan is a ﬁrst lien securing an ownership interest in a co-op corporation, the amount of the ﬁrst lien and prorated share of the co-op corporation blanket mortgage cannot exceed Fannie Mae’s loan limits.
Fannie Mae has no minimum original loan amount requirement for either whole loans or MBS loans.
Loan Limits and Modiﬁed Loans
Loan limits for modiﬁed loans are based on the original loan amount of the loan and not on the unpaid principal balance of the loan at the time of modiﬁcation or acquisition by Fannie Mae. A modiﬁed loan with an original loan amount exceeding the current loan limit is not eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae, even though the balance at the time of the modiﬁcation may be at or below the current applicable loan limit.

Ability to Repay Loan Eligibility Requirements
The following provisions apply to loans with application dates on or after January 10, 2014.
Note: As to any loan for which the original application was made before January 10, 2014, but which was assumed on or after January 10, 2014, and subsequently purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae, then, for eligibility purposes, the application date is considered to be the date on which Truth in Lending Act disclosure requirements were triggered with respect to such assumption.
ATR Covered Loans. An ATR Covered Loan is a loan subject to the TILA’s ability to repay requirements under Regulation Z and is otherwise not an ATR Exempt Loan (deﬁned below). An ATR Covered Loan must meet the following requirements in addition to the other underwriting and eligibility requirements in the Selling Guide:
have a loan term not exceeding 30 years (see Acceptable Loan Terms below);
be a fully amortizing loan, as deﬁned in Regulation Z:
the loan must have regular periodic payments that are substantially equal that do not result in an increase in the principal balance or allow the borrower to defer repayment of principal;
have total points and fees as described below under Points and Fees Limitations; and
have an APR-APOR spread as described below under APR-APOR Spread Limitations.
The ATR Covered Loan requirements apply to acquisitions of newly originated loans (including government mortgage loans). These requirements do not apply to certain assumptions or modiﬁcations of existing Fannie Mae loans regardless of the dates on which the loans being assumed or modiﬁed were originally closed. Refer to the regulation for the applicable requirements.
ATR Exempt Loans. An ATR Exempt Loan is, with certain exceptions, a loan that either is not subject to TILA or is exempt from the ability to repay requirements in Regulation Z (12 CFR § 1026.43(a) or (d)). For purposes of determining whether a loan is an ATR Exempt Loan, lenders must follow the TILA and Regulation Z deﬁnitions.
Note: The classiﬁcation of certain transactions for TILA purposes and for eligibility and underwriting purposes by Fannie Mae do not always align. For example, Fannie Mae deﬁnes a four-unit property where the borrower occupies one of the units as a “principal residence.” If under TILA such a loan is considered to be for commercial or business purposes, it will be exempt from TILA and therefore considered an ATR Exempt Loan by Fannie Mae.
Published February 5, 2025
208
Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes ATR Exempt Loans as long as such loans meet the other eligibility and underwriting requirements described in this Guide.
Points and Fees Limitations. For purposes of these requirements, “total points and fees” and “total loan amount” must be calculated in accordance with Regulation Z (12 CFR § 1026.32).
ATR Covered Loans: Total points and fees may not exceed 3% of the total loan amount or such diﬀerent amount in accordance with the qualiﬁed mortgage provisions of Regulation Z (12 CFR § 1026.43(e)(3)(i)). If a lender makes a cure payment in the amount and by the time required by 12 CFR § 1026.43(e)(3)(iii), such loan satisﬁes this requirement.
ATR Exempt Loans: Total points and fees may not exceed 5% of the total loan amount. This determination may take into account either of the following adjustments:
permitted reduction of total points and fees pursuant to 12 CFR § 1026.31(h); or
in the case of loans not subject to TILA, restitution to the borrower of at least that portion of total points and fees that exceeded 5% at the time of loan closing.
APR-APOR Spread Limitations. Eﬀective for loans with applications dates on and after July 1, 2021, the APR- APOR spread is the maximum diﬀerence by which the loan's APR cannot exceed the APOR. (Note: Loans with application dates before July 1, 2021 provided the loans otherwise meet the Revised QM Rule.)
ATR Covered Loans: The spread may not exceed 2.25% or a diﬀerent amount as speciﬁed in the Revised General QM Rule, calculated in accordance with the provisions of that rule.
Note: For ARMs with initial ﬁxed periods of ﬁve years or less, the APR must be calculated using the maximum interest rate that could apply during the ﬁrst ﬁve years after the ﬁrst payment is due.
ATR Exempt Loans: The spread may not exceed 6.5% or more calculated in accordance with the Revised General QM rule.
Acceptable Loan Terms
Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes loans that have original terms up to 30 years. The term of a ﬁrst mortgage may not extend more than 30 years beyond the date that is one month prior to the date of the ﬁrst payment. The minimum original term is 85 months, subject to applicable committing and delivery requirements for whole loans and loans in MBS.
Exception: The only exception to these requirements is for single-closing construction-to-permanent loans, which must have a loan term not exceeding 30 years after conversion to permanent ﬁnancing (disregarding the construction period). See B5-3.1-02, Conversion of Construction-to-Permanent Financing: Single-Closing Transactions.
HOEPA and State Higher-Priced Loans
A loan that is subject to the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (HOEPA), as described in Section 32 of Regulation Z, is not eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae.

Impact of Special Assessments on Maximum Loan Amount
If special assessments have been levied against the property and they are not paid before or at closing, the maximum loan amount otherwise available must be reduced by the amount of the unpaid special assessments (unless suﬃcient deposits to pay them will be collected as part of the loan payment).
If the security property may be subject to liens for taxes and special assessments and the liens are not yet due and payable, Fannie Mae does not consider these conditions, restrictions, and encumbrances material and does not require a reduction in the maximum loan amount.
The lender must provide documentation to show that the current installments of taxes and assessments (or future installments of special assessments that have been levied) - including those which may have been
Published February 5, 2025
212
attached as prior liens, but which are not now in arrears - have been paid or that suﬃcient deposits are being collected to pay them.
Premium Pricing
Premium pricing refers to situations when a borrower selects a higher interest rate on a loan in exchange for a lender credit. The lender credit cannot be used to fund any portion of the borrower’s down payment, and should not exceed the amount needed to oﬀset the borrower’s closing costs.
Any excess lender credit required to be returned to the borrower in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements is considered an overpayment of fees and charges, and may be applied as a principal curtailment or returned in cash to the borrower. See the following sections for additional details on lender credits derived from premium pricing:
B3-4.1-01, Minimum Reserve Requirements
B3-4.1-02, Interested Party Contributions (IPCs)
B3-4.3-06, Grants and Lender Contributions
B5-5.1-02, Community Seconds Loan Eligibility
Private Transfer Fee Covenants
In accordance with a regulation issued by the Federal Housing Finance Agency on March 16, 2012, as amended, and codiﬁed at 12 CFR Part 1228 (the “Private Transfer Fee Regulation”), except as provided below, Fannie Mae will not purchase or securitize loans on properties encumbered by private transfer fee covenants if those covenants were created on or after February 8, 2011, unless permitted by the Private Transfer Fee Regulation.
The lender must establish policies and/or procedures to ensure that the loans it delivers to Fannie Mae, whether or not the loans were originated by the lender, are not secured by properties encumbered with a private transfer fee that is unacceptable under the Private Transfer Fee Regulation. The policies and/or procedures will be reviewed by Fannie Mae as part of the lender’s operational review process.
As with all other federal, state, and local laws, the lender (and any third-party originator it uses) must be aware of, and in full compliance with, the Private Transfer Fee Regulation. (Refer to the Private Transfer Regulation for further detail concerning acceptable and unacceptable private transfer fee covenants, as well as the deﬁnitions of “private transfer fee” and “private transfer fee covenant.”)
Fannie Mae will purchase loans secured by properties encumbered by excepted transfer fee covenants (as deﬁned in the Private Transfer Fee Regulation), including those that are part of shared equity transactions. See B5-5.3-02, Shared Equity Transactions: General Requirements .
Age of Loan
To be eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae on a ﬂow basis, a loan must be no more than six months old
Published February 5, 2025
213
measured from the ﬁrst payment date to the "Purchase Ready" date (whole loans) or the MBS pool issue date (MBS loans).
For example, if a whole loan is in "Purchase Ready" status in May 2023 or an MBS loan is in a May 1, 2023 issued pool, the ﬁrst payment date can be no earlier than December 1, 2022.
NOTE: HomeStyle Renovation loans that are not delivered until renovation is complete (and delivered with SFC 279) can be sold up to 15 months after the note date. See B5-3.2-01, HomeStyle Renovation Mortgages for additional requirements.
Property Value for Loans Sold More than Four Months from Note Date
For loans that are more than four months old from the date of the note to the date the loan is sold to Fannie Mae, the current value of the property cannot be less than the original value. If the lender is unable to warrant that the current value of the property is not less than the original value of the property, the loan is not eligible for sale to Fannie Mae by the lender except on a negotiated basis.
Seasoned Loans
Seasoned loans are loans that are more than one year old from the ﬁrst payment date to:
the loan purchase date for whole loans, or
the pool issue date for MBS loans.
Note: Fannie Mae restricts purchase or securitization of seasoned loans to those that are delivered as a negotiated transaction. Contact Fannie Mae customer account team for additional information.
The table below provides the requirements for seasoned loans.
✓
Seasoned Loan Requirements
Seasoned loans may not be included in Fannie Majors MBS pools. See Chapter C3–6, Pooling
Loans into Fannie Majors.
The lender’s underwriting of the borrower’s credit and the security property for a seasoned
loan must meet the current requirements set out in this Guide.
The borrower has not had a 30-day delinquency in the 12-month period that precedes the
lender’s delivery of the loan to Fannie Mae.
If the current borrower assumed the loan and has owned the property for less than 12 months,
they must have had no 30-day delinquencies since purchasing the property.
Published February 5, 2025
214
✓
Seasoned Loan Requirements
The borrower’s ability to pay must not have changed adversely.
Note: If the loan has been assumed, the new borrower’s credit must be fully documented and
underwritten in accordance with the same standards used for new loans, unless the transfer of
ownership was one of the exempt transactions that legally prohibit a credit review. See the
Servicing Guide for an explanation of exempt transactions.
The current value of the property cannot be less than the original value. If the lender is unable
to provide this warranty, the loan is not eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae by the lender
except on a negotiated basis.
The status of the title to the property must not have been aﬀected adversely.
The loan must satisfy Fannie Mae’s current applicable mortgage eligibility requirements.
If the loan is secured by a unit in a condo, co-op, or PUD project, the project must satisfy
Fannie Mae’s current applicable project eligibility requirements.
If the loan was modiﬁed prior to delivery to Fannie Mae, it must be a modiﬁcation that is
eligible for delivery in accordance with the requirements of this Guide as described below
under Modiﬁed Loans.
Except to the extent otherwise expressly permitted in the Selling Guide ( A2-3.2-01, Loan
Repurchases and Make Whole Payments Requested by Fannie Mae), or the Servicing Guide
with respect to the redelivery of loans to Fannie Mae, the loan being delivered cannot be one
that was required to be repurchased by a secondary market investor, government-sponsored
enterprise, or private institutional investor other than Fannie Mae for any documentation,
underwriting, property valuation, or other deﬁciencies and/or issues with the property
(including project eligibility if the property is in a condo, co-op, or PUD project), borrower
credit or other deﬁciencies or for any other reason.
Modiﬁed Loans
A modiﬁed loan is a loan that was legally modiﬁed after loan closing in a way that changed any of the loan terms or attributes reﬂected in the original note. In general, loans with material modiﬁcations, such as changes to the original loan amount, interest rate, ﬁnal maturity, or product structure, are not eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae.
A loan whose note was corrected to eﬀect technical or typographical corrections is not considered to be a modiﬁed loan and is eligible for delivery. All of the changes must correct errors in the executed documents,
Published February 5, 2025
215
which reﬂect the terms of the original loan transaction. None of the changes can be the result of a subsequent modiﬁcation or amendment to the original loan amount, interest rate, or other material loan term. The correction may not result in a change to, or create any inconsistencies with, other legal documents.
Fannie Mae permits the delivery of certain other modiﬁed loans based primarily on whether the loan was owned or securitized by Fannie Mae prior to the modiﬁcation, or the modiﬁcation of the loan was done in accordance with a standard product or is common and customary in a certain area.
The table below provides a comprehensive overview of Fannie Mae requirements applicable to the delivery of modiﬁed loans. If the loan is not eligible in accordance with standard Selling Guide provisions, it may be eligible in accordance with a variance. Such variances may be subject to additional terms and conditions.

Borrower Principal Curtailment and Recast Over Remaining Term
Fannie Mae will purchase a re-amortized loan following the application of a principal curtailment received from the borrower. The curtailment reduces the principal balance and monthly mortgage payment over the remaining term of the loan. The following requirements must be met:
The only changes to the original note terms are a corresponding reduction in the principal balance and a re-amortized reduction to the monthly mortgage payment. The original note amount must comply with maximum loan limits in eﬀect at the time of acquisition. See B2-1.5-01, Loan Limits. When the loan was underwritten, the borrower was fully qualiﬁed based on the original note amount. The loan must be delivered with Special Feature Code 76. The lender must complete an Agreement for Modiﬁcation, Re-Amortization, or Extension of Mortgage (Form 181), in accordance with the requirements of the Servicing Guide, place a copy in the loan servicing ﬁle, and deliver the completed documents to the applicable document custodian in accordance with Selling Guide E-2-01, Required Custodial Documents. The delivery data must comply with the delivery instructions for principal curtailments.

See B2-1.5-05, Principal Curtailments for additional requirements related to principal curtailments.
Nonstandard Payment Collection Options
A nonstandard payment collection option is a payment option that permits the borrower to make loan payments on a schedule other than a monthly basis. If the nonstandard payment collection option terms are included in the loan documents, then the loan is ineligible for delivery to Fannie Mae.
Lenders may oﬀer nonstandard payment collection plans as part of a separate agreement; however, the loan is eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae only under the following conditions:
the agreement must not impact the terms and conditions of the mortgage note, nor the reporting or remittance of payments to Fannie Mae;
the agreement must be cancelable by the borrower without cost; and
the loan must be identiﬁable by the lender such that the information can be provided to Fannie Mae upon request.

First Mortgage Lien Position Personal Property Rental Property Leases Mortgages with a Capitalization Option Mortgages Permitting Open-end Advances
First Mortgage Lien Position
If the mortgage being delivered to Fannie Mae is a ﬁrst mortgage, the lien of the security instrument must be a ﬁrst and paramount lien on the borrower’s estate in the real property.
Personal Property
Personal property may not be included as additional security for any mortgage on a one-unit property unless otherwise speciﬁed by Fannie Mae. For example, certain personal property is pledged when the Multistate Rider and Addenda ( Form 3170) is used.
Rental Property Leases
Leases that predate the mortgage could have a superior claim to the mortgage. Furthermore, state laws may diﬀer on the relationship between an unrecorded lease and a subsequent mortgage. The lender is responsible for ensuring clear title and ﬁrst lien enforceability in accordance with A2-2-07, Life-of-Loan Representations and Warranties
Mortgages with a Capitalization Option
Some mortgage instruments permit the note holder to capitalize delinquent interest or sums advanced to pay
Published February 5, 2025
219
insurance premiums, property taxes, or other expenses required to protect the value of the security property by adding them to the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage.
Fannie Mae will not purchase or securitize mortgages where any such funds have been capitalized or advanced by the note holder prior to delivery to Fannie Mae.
Mortgages Permitting Open-end Advances
Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes a mortgage that includes an open-end advance provision only if the provision gives Fannie Mae the option not to make any advances. If funds were advanced prior to delivery, the transaction is considered a modiﬁed mortgage that is not eligible for delivery. See B2-1.5-02, Loan Eligibility.

B2-1.5-04, Escrow Accounts (04/01/2020)
Introduction This topic contains information on escrow accounts, including:
Escrow Accounts Escrow Waivers
Escrow Accounts
First mortgages generally must provide for the deposit of escrow funds to pay as they come due, including taxes, ground rents, premiums for property insurance, and premiums for ﬂood insurance. However, escrow deposits for the payment of premiums for borrower-purchased mortgage insurance (if applicable) are mandatory. For the calculation of the monthly real estate tax payment lenders must comply with all federal and state regulations in calculating the amount to be collected for any established escrow account.
Fannie Mae does not require an escrow deposit for property or ﬂood insurance premiums for an individual unit in a condo, co-op, or PUD when the project in which the unit is located is covered by a blanket insurance policy purchased by the homeowners’ association or co-op corporation.
Published February 5, 2025
220
If a special assessment levied against the property was not paid at loan closing, the borrower’s payment must include appropriate accruals to ensure that any estimated annual payment toward the assessment will be accumulated by the time it comes due.
For certain reﬁnance transactions where the borrower is ﬁnancing real estate taxes in the loan amount, an escrow account is required, subject to applicable laws or regulations. See B2-1.3-03, Cash-Out Reﬁnance Transactions for more information.
Escrow Waivers
Fannie Mae advocates the establishment of an escrow account for the payment of taxes and insurance, particularly for borrowers with blemished credit histories or ﬁrst-time homeowners.
Unless required by law, lenders may waive escrow account requirements for an individual ﬁrst mortgage, provided the standard escrow provision remains in the mortgage loan legal documents. Lenders cannot waive an escrow account for certain reﬁnance transactions (see above) or for the payment of premiums for borrower- purchased mortgage insurance (if applicable). When the requirement for an escrow account is waived, the lender must retain Fannie Mae’s right to enforce the requirement in appropriate circumstances.
Lenders must have a written policy governing the circumstances under which escrow accounts may be waived. When a lender permits escrow waivers, subject to the mortgage documents and applicable law, the lender’s written policies must provide that the waiver not be based solely on the LTV ratio of a loan, but also on whether the borrower has the ﬁnancial ability to handle the lump sum payments of taxes, insurance, and other items described above.

B2-1.5-05, Principal Curtailments (11/06/2024)
Introduction This topic contains information on principal curtailments, including:
Overview Acceptable Curtailments Documentation Delivery Instructions
Overview
A principal curtailment is the application of funds used to reduce the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loan. Fannie Mae permits certain curtailments prior to loan delivery provided the delivery data reﬂects the curtailment as described below.
Acceptable Curtailments
Fannie Mae permits curtailments prior to loan delivery for the following reasons:
The lender may apply a principal curtailment to refund the overpayment of fees or charges paid by the borrower, in any amount, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.
If the borrower receives more cash back than is permitted for limited cash-out reﬁnances, the lender can apply a curtailment to reduce the amount of cash back to the borrower to bring the loan into compliance with the maximum cash-back requirement. The maximum amount of the curtailment cannot exceed the lesser of $2,500 or 2% of the original loan amount for the subject loan. For example, if the borrower received $3,500 cash back at closing on a loan amount of $200,000, the lender could apply a $1,500 curtailment prior to delivery to Fannie Mae. This would result in “net cash back” to the borrower of $2,000, thus meeting Fannie Mae’s limited cash-out reﬁnance requirement.
Fannie Mae also allows additional principal payments remitted by a borrower to prepay the mortgage loan as permitted by the loan documents. This includes curtailments applied to the principal balance to reduce the monthly mortgage payment. See B2-1.5-02, Loan Eligibility.
Lenders must apply these curtailments prior to delivery of the loan to Fannie Mae. Such curtailments may not be held until after whole loan delivery or for application in the month subsequent to issuance of an MBS.
Fannie Mae permits a lender to apply a curtailment after loan delivery to refund the overpayment of fees or charges paid by the borrower in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, provided the amount of the curtailment does not exceed $500. All other curtailments received after loan delivery must be applied in accordance with the Servicing Guide.
Documentation
Published February 5, 2025
222
If the curtailment is made at the time of closing, the amount must be clearly documented on the settlement statement. If the curtailment is applied after closing, but before delivery, the loan ﬁle must be documented with the amount of the curtailment and the reason or source of the curtailment (for example, lender refund or borrower-initiated), and include any modiﬁcation agreement used to reduce the monthly payment following the application of the curtailment.
If the lender elects to apply a principal curtailment after delivery to refund the overpayment of fees and charges as permitted above, the loan ﬁle must be documented with the amount, reason, and source of the curtailment.
Delivery Instructions
Refer to the Loan Modiﬁcations Job Aid for the delivery of loans impacted by a curtailment applied prior to the delivery of the loan to Fannie Mae.

This chapter explains the requirements related to borrower eligibility.

General Borrower Eligibility Requirements General Borrower Identity Criteria Tax Identiﬁcation Numbers Establishing Borrower Ownership Interest
General Borrower Eligibility Requirements
Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes mortgages made to borrowers who are natural persons and have reached the age at which the mortgage note can be enforced in the jurisdiction where the property is located. There is no maximum age limit for a borrower.
Exceptions to the requirement that borrowers be natural persons are:
inter vivos revocable trusts,
HomeStyle Renovation mortgages, and
land trusts in those states where the beneﬁciary is an individual. (Note: Fannie Mae permits land trusts on a negotiated basis for states where land trusts are widely accepted.)
See the following for additional information:
B2-1.3-04, Prohibited Reﬁnancing Practices,
B2-2-04, Guarantors, Co-Signers, or Non-Occupant Borrowers on the Subject Transaction
B2-2-05, Inter Vivos Revocable Trusts,
B5-3.2-02, HomeStyle Renovation Mortgages: Loan and Borrower Eligibility, and
Community Land Trusts in B5-5.3-01, Shared Equity Overview.
General Borrower Identity Criteria
A borrower is any applicant (e.g., individually or jointly) whose credit is used for qualifying purposes to determine ability to meet Fannie Mae’s underwriting and eligibility standards. “Co-borrower” is a term used to describe any borrower other than the borrower whose name appears ﬁrst on the note.
Lenders must conﬁrm each borrower’s identity prior to the extension of credit. Fannie Mae’s requirements for borrower identity veriﬁcation are intended to align with lenders’ existing federal obligations under laws requiring information and document veriﬁcation, including the Department of Treasury's Oﬃce of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) regulations and the U.S. Patriot Act. See A3-2-01, Compliance With Laws, for additional information concerning borrower identity veriﬁcation.
Tax Identiﬁcation Numbers
Fannie Mae requires that each borrower have a valid Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identiﬁcation Number (ITIN), in addition to meeting existing legal residency and documentation requirements.
Published February 5, 2025
224
(For additional information, see B2-2-02, Non–U.S. Citizen Borrower Eligibility Requirements.)
DU and Loan Delivery may identify data integrity issues pertaining to the borrower’s Social Security number. Lenders must take steps to resolve any issues, including invalid format, numbers not issued, borrower age/issue date discrepancies, or Social Security numbers associated with deceased individuals. If a lender cannot resolve any Social Security number inconsistencies, the lender must validate the Social Security number directly with the Social Security Administration (SSA). The following requirements apply:
The lender may use one of the two methods listed below to validate a borrower's Social Security number:
Form SSA–89 (Authorization for the Social Security Administration to Release Social Security Number Veriﬁcation), or Electronic Consent Based Social Security Number Veriﬁcation (eCBSV) Service.
If using a third-party vendor, the lender must ensure that the vendor goes directly to the SSA to validate the Social Security number using one of the two methods listed above.
The lender must retain documentation in the loan ﬁle that evidences the validation of the Social Security number.
The lender must deliver the loan with SFC 162 if the Social Security number was validated through the SSA but there is a discrepancy identiﬁed with the Social Security number in the credit report, DU, or Loan Delivery edits.
If the Social Security number cannot be validated with the SSA, the loan is not eligible for sale to Fannie Mae.
Establishing Borrower Ownership Interest
A borrower must establish ownership interest in the security property and become liable for the note (whether individually or jointly) by:
signing the security instrument,
signing the mortgage or deed of trust note, and
taking title to the property in the name of the individual borrower(s).

Fannie Mae does not specify the precise documentation the lender must obtain to verify that a non–U.S. citizen borrower is legally present in the United States. The lender must make a determination of the non–U.S. citizen’s status based on the circumstances of the individual case, using documentation it deems appropriate. By delivering the mortgage to Fannie Mae, the lender represents and warrants that the non–U.S. citizen borrower is legally present in this country.

Exception: High LTV reﬁnance loans are exempt from the multiple ﬁnanced property policies. See B5-7-01, High LTV Reﬁnance Loan and Borrower Eligibility for additional information on these loans.
The number of ﬁnanced properties calculation includes:
the number of one- to four-unit residential properties where the borrower is personally obligated on the mortgage(s), even if the monthly housing expense is excluded from the borrower’s DTI in accordance with B3-6-05, Monthly Debt Obligations
the total number of properties ﬁnanced (not the number of mortgages on the property nor the number of mortgages sold to Fannie Mae), with multiple unit properties (such as a two-unit) counting as one property;
the borrower’s principal residence if it is ﬁnanced; and
the cumulative total for all borrowers (though jointly ﬁnanced properties are only counted once). For HomeReady loans, ﬁnanced properties owned by a non-occupant co-borrower that are owned separately from the borrower are excluded from the number of ﬁnanced properties calculation.
The following property types are not subject to these limitations, even if the borrower is personally obligated on a mortgage on the property:
commercial real estate,
multifamily property consisting of more than four units,
ownership in a timeshare,
ownership of a vacant lot (residential or commercial), or
ownership of a manufactured home on a leasehold estate not titled as real property (chattel lien on the home).
Examples — Counting Financed Properties
A HomeReady borrower is purchasing a principal residence and is obligated on a mortgage securing an investment property. A non-occupant co-borrower is solely obligated on mortgages securing three investment properties. In this instance, the transaction is eligible for HomeReady, as the occupant

borrower will have two ﬁnanced properties. The non-occupant co-borrower’s ﬁnanced properties are not included in the property count.
The borrower is personally obligated on mortgages securing two investment properties and the co- borrower is personally obligated on mortgages securing three other investment properties, and they are jointly obligated on their principal residence mortgage. The borrower is reﬁnancing the mortgage on one of the two investment properties. Thus, the borrowers have six ﬁnanced properties.
The borrower and co-borrower are purchasing an investment property and they are already jointly obligated on the mortgages securing ﬁve other investment properties. In addition, they each own their own principal residence and are personally obligated on the mortgages. The new property being purchased is considered the borrowers' eighth ﬁnanced property.
The borrower is purchasing a second home and is personally obligated on their principal residence mortgage. Additionally, the borrower owns four two-unit investment properties that are ﬁnanced in the name of a limited liability company (LLC) of which they have a 50% ownership. Because the borrower is not personally obligated on the mortgages securing the investment properties, they are not included in the property count and the result is only two ﬁnanced properties.
The borrower is purchasing and ﬁnancing two investment properties simultaneously. The borrower does not have a mortgage lien against their principal residence but does have a ﬁnanced second home and is personally obligated on the mortgage, two existing ﬁnanced investment properties and is personally obligated on both mortgages, and a ﬁnanced building lot. In this instance, the borrower will have ﬁve ﬁnanced properties because the ﬁnanced building lot is not included in the property count.
Reserve Requirements
Additional reserve requirements apply to second home and investment properties based on the number of ﬁnanced properties the borrower will have. The borrower must have suﬃcient assets to close after meeting the minimum reserve requirements. See B3-4.1-01, Minimum Reserve Requirements, for the ﬁnanced properties requirements. The additional reserve requirements do not apply to HomeReady transactions.
Applying the Multiple Financed Property Policy to DU Loan Caseﬁles
If the borrower is ﬁnancing a second home or investment property that is underwritten through DU and the borrower will have one to six ﬁnanced properties, Fannie Mae’s standard eligibility policies apply (for example, LTV ratios and minimum credit scores). If the borrower will have seven to ten ﬁnanced properties, the mortgage loan must have a minimum representative credit score of 720; all other standard eligibility policies apply.
DU will determine the number of ﬁnanced properties for the loan caseﬁle based on the following data in the online loan application:
If the Number of Financed Properties ﬁeld is completed, DU will use that as the number of ﬁnanced properties. The lender must complete this ﬁeld with the number of ﬁnanced one- to four-unit residential properties (including the subject transaction) for which the borrower(s) are personally obligated.
If the Number of Financed Properties ﬁeld is not provided, DU will use the number of residential properties in the Real Estate Owned (REO) section that include a mortgage payment, or that are associated with a mortgage or HELOC, as the number of ﬁnanced properties. Properties that are identiﬁed as commercial, multifamily, land, or farm in the Other Description ﬁeld for each speciﬁc REO will not be
Published February 5, 2025

used when determining the number of ﬁnanced properties.
If the Number of Financed Properties ﬁeld and the REO information was not provided, DU will use the number of mortgages and HELOCs disclosed in the loan application as the number of ﬁnanced properties. Note that in order for an accurate assessment of the loan to be performed, the REO data must be provided for all owned properties.
When none of the information above is provided on the online loan application, DU will use the number of mortgages and HELOCs disclosed on the credit report as the number of ﬁnanced properties.
Note: In order to account for the subject property, DU will add “1” to the number of ﬁnanced properties on purchase and construction transactions when the REO section, number of mortgages on the application, or number of mortgages on the credit report are used as the number of ﬁnanced properties.
After determining the number of ﬁnanced properties, DU will use that value to assess the eligibility of the loan, including the minimum credit score requirement for seven to ten ﬁnanced properties, the minimum required reserves the lender must verify, and eligibility for HomeReady transactions.
DU will issue a message informing the lender of the number of ﬁnanced properties that DU used and where that information was obtained (Number of Financed Properties ﬁeld, REO section, number of mortgages on application, or number of mortgages on credit report). If DU used the information provided in the Number of Financed Properties ﬁeld or in the REO section, and that information is inaccurate, the lender must update the data and resubmit the loan caseﬁle to DU. If DU used the number of mortgages and HELOCs on the loan application or credit report as the number of ﬁnanced properties, and that number is inaccurate, the lender must provide the correct number in the Number of Financed Properties ﬁeld, or complete the REO section of the loan application and resubmit the loan caseﬁle to DU.

Down Payment and Qualifying Ratio Requirements for Manually Underwritten Loans
For manually underwritten loans, if the income of a guarantor, co-signer, or non-occupant borrower is used for qualifying purposes, the occupying borrower(s) must make the ﬁrst 5% of the down payment from their own funds unless:
the LTV or CLTV ratio is less than or equal to 80%; or
the occupying borrower is purchasing a one-unit principal residence and meets the requirements to use gifts, donated grant funds, or funds received from an employer to pay for some or all of the borrower’s minimum contribution. See B3-4.3-04, Personal Gifts; B3-4.3-06, Grants and Lender Contributions; and B3-4.3-08, Employer Assistance, for additional information.
Using only the income of the occupying borrower(s) to calculate the DTI ratio, the maximum allowable DTI ratio is 43%.
Note: This policy applies even if the combined qualifying ratios for the borrower and the guarantor, co- signer, or non-occupant borrower are well below Fannie Mae’s standard qualifying ratio benchmark. Minimum credit score and reserve requirements based on the LTV ratio and combined qualifying ratios of all borrowers must be met per the Eligibility Matrix. See Section B3–5.4, Nontraditional Credit History, for additional requirements that apply when the transaction includes a borrower who does not have a credit score.
For additional information, see B3-6-02, Debt-to-Income Ratios.
LTV Ratio Requirements for Manually Underwritten Loans
For manually underwritten loans, if the income of a guarantor, co-signer, or co-borrower is used for qualifying purposes, and that guarantor, co-signer, or co-borrower will not occupy the subject property, the maximum LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratio may not exceed 90% (unless a Community Seconds is part of the transaction, in which case the CLTV ratio may not exceed 105% where permitted in the Eligibility Matrix.
LTV Ratio Requirements for Loan Caseﬁles Underwritten through DU
DU analyzes the risk factors in the loan caseﬁle for all borrowers on the mortgage loan. Regardless of whether an individual borrower will be occupying the property as their principal residence, DU will consider the income, assets, liabilities, and credit of that borrower.
For DU loan caseﬁles, if the income of a guarantor, co-signer, or co-borrower is used for qualifying purposes, and that guarantor, co-signer, or co-borrower will not occupy the subject property, the maximum LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratio may not exceed 95% (unless a Community Seconds is part of the transaction, in which case the CLTV ratio may not exceed 105% where permitted in the Eligibility Matrix.

B2-2-05, Inter Vivos Revocable Trusts (10/31/2017)
Introduction This topic contains information on revocable trusts, including:
Overview Inter Vivos Revocable Trust as Eligible Mortgagor Lender Requirements Trust and Trustee Requirements Eligible Property and Occupancy Types Underwriting Considerations Title and Title Insurance Requirements Loan Delivery Data
Overview
Except as expressly provided elsewhere in the Selling Guide, Fannie Mae only accepts individuals as credit- qualifying borrowers. In addition, Fannie Mae normally deems property in which no borrower has an ownership interest as ineligible collateral. However, to accommodate the use of inter vivos trusts as an estate planning tool, Fannie Mae provides an exception for property held by inter vivos revocable trusts created by credit- qualifying borrowers.
Inter Vivos Revocable Trust as Eligible Mortgagor
An inter vivos revocable trust is a trust that
an individual creates during their lifetime;
becomes eﬀective during its creator’s lifetime; and
can be changed or canceled by its creator at any time, for any reason, during that individual’s lifetime.
Fannie Mae will accept an inter vivos revocable trust that has an ownership interest in the security property as an eligible mortgagor (a party to the security instrument) for all transaction types, provided it complies with the requirements in this topic.
Published February 5, 2025
232
Note: A trust must meet Fannie Mae’s revocability and other eligibility requirements at the time the loan is delivered. Trust eligibility is not aﬀected if the trust documents contain a provision that the trust will, in the future, become irrevocable upon the death of one of the settlors. However, such a change in the trust structure after delivery of the mortgage loan may aﬀect the eligibility of the trust as a mortgagor in a subsequent loan transaction.
Lender Requirements
A lender delivering a loan that has an inter vivos revocable trust as mortgagor is responsible for:
determining that both the trust and the mortgage satisfy Fannie Mae eligibility criteria and documentation requirements;
determining under the laws of the states in which it does business that it can originate mortgages to validly created inter vivos revocable trusts that meet the terms and conditions speciﬁed by Fannie Mae; and
completing a review of the mortgage documentation, applicable state law, and the trust documents to ensure that title insurers provide full title insurance coverage without exceptions for the trust or the trustees for inter vivos revocable trusts in that state. (See Title and Title Insurance Requirements below for additional information.)
Legal document requirements are described in B8-5-02, Inter Vivos Revocable Trust Mortgage Documentation and Signature Requirements. Also see E-2-04, Signature Requirements for Mortgages to Inter Vivos Revocable Trusts, for signature requirements under diﬀerent inter vivos revocable trust scenarios.
Trust and Trustee Requirements
The inter vivos revocable trust must be established by one or more natural persons, solely or jointly. The primary beneﬁciary of the trust must be the individual(s) establishing the trust. If the trust is established jointly, there may be more than one primary beneﬁciary as long as the income or assets of at least one of the individuals establishing the trust will be used to qualify for the mortgage.
The trustee(s) must include either:
the individual establishing the trust (or at least one of the individuals, if there are two or more); or
an institutional trustee that customarily performs trust functions in and is authorized to act as trustee under the laws of the applicable state.
The trustee(s) must have the power to mortgage the security property for the purpose of securing a loan to the individual (or individuals) who are the borrower(s) under the mortgage or deed of trust note.
Note: In the event the originally named trustee is unable or unwilling to serve, and the trust instrument has a mechanism for appointment of a successor trustee, the trust can properly act through the successor trustee.
Published February 5, 2025
233
Eligible Property and Occupancy Types
All property and occupancy types are eligible. For properties that are the borrower's principal residence, at least one individual establishing the trust must occupy the security property and sign the loan documents.
Underwriting Considerations
The loan must be underwritten with at least one individual establishing the trust as borrower. Additional individuals, including other individuals establishing the trust, may also be considered co-borrowers if those individuals’ credit will be used to qualify for the loan.
Title and Title Insurance Requirements
The lender must retain in the individual loan ﬁle a copy of any trust documents that the title insurance company required in making its determination on the title insurance coverage.
The following requirements apply to title and title insurance:
Title held in the trust does not in any way diminish Fannie Mae’s rights as a creditor, including the right to have full title to the property vested in Fannie Mae should foreclosure proceedings have to be initiated to cure a default under the terms of the mortgage.
The title insurance policy ensures full title protection to Fannie Mae.
The title insurance policy states that title to the security property is vested in the trustee(s) of the inter vivos revocable trust.
The title insurance policy does not list any exceptions with respect to the trustee(s) holding title to the security property or to the trust.
Title to the security property is vested solely in the trustee(s) of the inter vivos revocable trust, jointly in the trustee(s) of the inter vivos revocable trust and in the name(s) of the individual borrower(s), or in the trustee(s) of more than one inter vivos revocable trust.
Loan Delivery Data
Only the information related to the individual(s) establishing the inter vivos revocable trust whose credit is used to qualify for the loan should be provided at the time of loan delivery, such as the borrower name and Social Security number. The name of the inter vivos revocable trust cannot be included within the loan delivery data.
A loan that has an inter vivos revocable trust as a mortgagor must be delivered with Special Feature Code 168 (in addition to any other special feature codes that may also be applicable to the transaction).

B2-2-06, Homeownership Education and Housing Counseling
(06/05/2024)
Introduction This topic contains information on homeownership education and housing counseling, including:
Overview Compliance with Law Deﬁnitions Transactions that Require Homeownership Education Meeting the Homeownership Education Requirement Housing Counseling Completion of Supplemental Consumer Information Form (Form 1103) Additional Resources Summary of Homeownership Education and Housing Counseling Options
Overview
Fannie Mae believes that credit and underwriting guidelines alone are not always enough to assess a borrower’s readiness for homeownership. High-quality homeownership education and housing counseling can provide the borrower with additional information and resources to make informed decisions that support long-term homeownership sustainability. Fannie Mae requires programs that are aligned with the National Industry Standards (NIS) for Homeownership Education and Counseling or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Counseling Program, or provided by a HUD-approved counseling agency.
Compliance with Law
All education, collection, and counseling eﬀorts must comply with the requirements of applicable federal and state laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
Deﬁnitions
The following deﬁnitions apply to these requirements:
Homeownership Education: Education with an established curriculum and instructional goals, provided in a group, classroom setting, or via other formats, that covers homeownership topics such as the home- buying process, how to maintain a home, budgeting, and the importance of good credit.
Housing Counseling: One-on-one assistance that addresses unique ﬁnancial circumstances and housing issues, and focuses on overcoming speciﬁc obstacles to achieve housing goals. Counseling includes topics such as repairing credit, locating cash for a down payment, recognizing predatory lending
Published February 5, 2025
235
practices, understanding fair lending and fair housing requirements, avoiding foreclosure, and resolving a ﬁnancial crisis. All housing counseling involves the creation of a budget and a written action plan and includes a homeownership education component.
Transactions that Require Homeownership Education
For the following transactions, at least one borrower on the loan must complete homeownership education prior to loan closing:
if all borrowers on the loan are relying solely on nontraditional credit to qualify, regardless of the loan product or whether the borrowers are ﬁrst-time homebuyers;
HomeReady purchase transactions when all occupying borrowers are ﬁrst-time homebuyers; or
purchase transactions with LTV, CLTV, or HCLTV ratios greater than 95%, when all borrowers are ﬁrst- time homebuyers.
Note: The requirements that apply to purchases also apply to construction-to-permanent transactions that are processed as a purchase.
Meeting the Homeownership Education Requirement
To satisfy the homeownership education requirement, Fannie Mae permits any qualiﬁed third-party provider, independent of the lender, to administer homeownership education. The provider’s content must be aligned with NIS or HUD standards. The education may be delivered in various formats (in-person, Internet, via telephone, or a hybrid format). In lieu of homeownership education, the borrower may receive housing counseling.
The lender must conﬁrm the course content is aligned with NIS or HUD standards and must retain a copy of the certiﬁcate of course completion in the loan ﬁle.
Housing Counseling
Housing counseling must be provided by a HUD-approved agency and meet HUD standards for the delivery of this service. The following requirements apply when counseling is obtained to satisfy the homeowner education requirement above:
If a borrower opts to work with a housing counselor, completion of housing counseling prior to closing will also satisfy Fannie Mae’s homeownership education requirement. The lender must retain a copy of the certiﬁcate of course completion in the loan ﬁle. HomeReady loans where borrowers who complete housing counseling within 12 months prior to closing may be eligible for a loan-level price adjustment credit. For the LLPA credit to be applied to the loan
the Housing Counseling data must be submitted to DU, and the loan must be delivered with SFC 184.
See Chapter B5-6, HomeReady Mortgage for additional information.
Published February 5, 2025
236
Note: References to the use of a HUD-approved agency include aﬃliated agencies (as deﬁned in the HUD Housing Counseling Program Handbook) participating in a HUD program through a HUD-approved intermediary or State Housing Finance Agency.
Completion of Supplemental Consumer Information Form (Form 1103)
Lenders are required to present the Supplemental Consumer Information Form (Form 1103) to the borrower. The lender or borrower should complete the Homeownership Education and Housing Counseling section of the form for those transactions where homeownership education or housing counseling is required.
Any data collected that is associated with Form 1103 should be provided to DU. Though not required for underwriting, the date of completion and Housing Counseling Agency ID must be provided to DU on loans for HomeReady borrowers eligible for the housing counseling LLPA credit referenced above.
Additional Resources
Fannie Mae provides additional resources to lenders, borrowers, and nonproﬁt agencies in support of homeownership education and housing counseling on its website.

Introduction This topic contains information on Fannie Mae’s property eligibility requirements, including:
Overview Number of Units Property Location Property Requirements Acceptable Forms of Property Ownership Acceptable Dwelling Types Ineligible Properties Loan-Level Price Adjustments
Overview
Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes eligible mortgages in all markets across a broad geographic range. This topic describes Fannie Mae’s property eligibility requirements. The requirements are designed to address a wide range of property types with varying characteristics; however, there may be instances when the unique nature of a particular property may require special consideration. In those cases, Fannie Mae encourages lenders to contact their Fannie Mae customer account team.
Number of Units
Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes ﬁrst-lien mortgages that are secured by residential properties when the dwelling consists of one to four units. Under some circumstances, Fannie Mae limits the number of dwelling units for certain types of mortgages or transactions. For the maximum allowable LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios and credit score requirements based on the property type and number of units, see the Eligibility Matrix.
Note: A one-unit property with an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) is deﬁned as a one-unit property and subject to all one-unit requirements, unless otherwise stated. See B2-3-04, Special Property Eligibility Considerations for additional information at ADUs.
Property Location
The security property must be located in
the United States (including the District of Columbia),
Puerto Rico,
the U.S. Virgin Islands, or
Guam.
Published February 5, 2025
240
Property Requirements
The mortgaged premises must be
residential in nature as deﬁned by the characteristics of the property and surrounding market area (see B4-1.3-03, Neighborhood Section of the Appraisal Report);
secured by an interest in real property within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code as such term is deﬁned in 26 C.F.R. § 1.856-3;
safe, sound, and structurally secure (see B4-1.3-06, Property Condition and Quality of Construction of the Improvements);
the highest and best use of the property as improved (or as proposed per plans and speciﬁcations), and the use of the property must be legal or legal non-conforming use (see B4-1.3-04, Site Section of the Appraisal Report);
readily accessible by roads that meet local standards (see B4-1.3-04, Site Section of the Appraisal Report);
served by utilities that meet community standards (see B4-1.3-04, Site Section of the Appraisal Report); and
suitable for year-round use.
Note: Certain aspects of the location of a property will require special consideration. For example, properties in resort areas that attract people for seasonal or vacation use are acceptable only if they are suitable for year-round use.
Acceptable Forms of Property Ownership
Title to the property must be held as fee simple, leasehold estate, or as a co-op form of ownership. (See B2-3-03, Special Property Eligibility and Underwriting Considerations: Leasehold Estates; and B4-2.3-04, Loan Eligibility for Co-op Share Loans, for additional information.)
Acceptable Dwelling Types
Dwelling units for security properties may be detached, attached, or semi-detached.
Properties may be located
on an individual lot,
in a condo project,
in a co-op project, or
in a planned unit development (PUD) or subdivision project.
Properties located in a condo, co-op, or PUD project must meet Fannie Mae’s project standards requirements

Ineligible Properties
Fannie Mae does not purchase or securitize mortgages on
vacant land or land development properties;
properties that are not readily accessible by roads that meet local standards;
agricultural properties, such as farms or ranches;
units in condo or co-op hotels (see B4-2.1-03, Ineligible Projects, for additional information;

boarding houses;
bed and breakfast properties; or
properties that are not suitable for year-round occupancy regardless of location.
Note: Group homes are not considered to be boarding houses. They are an eligible property type, including when leased to a business entity for use as a group home.
Loan-Level Price Adjustments
A Loan-Level Price Adjustment (LLPA) applies to certain property types, including multiple-unit properties and units in an attached condo project. These LLPAs are in addition to any other price adjustments that are otherwise applicable to the particular transaction. For the current LLPAs, see the Loan-Level Price Adjustment (LLPA) Matrix.

Requirements
The manufactured home must be built in compliance with
the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards that were established
June 15, 1976, as amended and in force at the time the home is manufactured; and
additional requirements that appear in HUD regulations at 24 C.F.R. Part 3280.
Compliance with these standards will be evidenced by the presence of either a HUD Data Plate
or the HUD Certiﬁcation Label(s) for each section of the home for existing construction. If the
original or alternative documentation cannot be obtained for either of these, the loan is not
eligible for sale to Fannie Mae. (Both are required for new construction).
Published February 5, 2025
243
✓
Requirements
The HUD Data Plate is a paper document located on the interior of the subject property that
contains, among other things, the manufacturer’s name and trade/model number. In addition
to the data required by Fannie Mae, the Data Plate includes pertinent information about the
unit, including a list of factory-installed equipment. The HUD Certiﬁcation Label(s), sometimes
referred to as a HUD “seal” or “tag,” is a metal plate located on the exterior of each section of
the home. The Manufactured Home Appraisal Report (Form 1004C) must have photos of either
the HUD Data Plate or the HUD Certiﬁcation Label(s).
As an alternative to the original HUD Certiﬁcation Label(s) or the HUD Data Plate, the lender
must obtain either a label veriﬁcation letter with the same information contained on the HUD
Certiﬁcation Label(s) or duplicate HUD Data Plate from the Institute for Building Technology
and Safety (IBTS). A duplicate HUD Data Plate may also be available by contacting the In-Plant
Primary Inspection Agency (IPIA) or the manufacturer. (A list of IPIA oﬃces is posted on HUD’s
website.)
The unit must not have been previously installed or occupied at any other site or location,
except from the manufacturer or the dealer’s lot as a new unit.
The manufactured home must be a one-unit dwelling that is legally classiﬁed as real property
and cannot include an accessory dwelling unit. See B2-3-04, Special Property Eligibility
Considerations for additional information.
The towing hitch, wheels, and axles must be removed. The dwelling must assume the
characteristics of site-built housing.
The manufactured home must be at least 12 feet wide and have a minimum of 400 square
feet of gross living area.
Except for MH Advantage properties, Fannie Mae does not specify other minimum
requirements for size, roof pitch, or any other speciﬁc construction details for HUD-coded
manufactured homes.
Site preparation for delivery of the manufactured home must be completed.
The manufactured home must be attached to a permanent foundation system in accordance
with the manufacturer’s requirements for anchoring, support, stability, and maintenance.
The foundation system must be appropriate for the soil conditions for the site and meet local
and state codes.
Published February 5, 2025
244
✓
Requirements
The manufactured home must be permanently connected to a septic tank or sewage system,
and to other utilities in accordance with local and state requirements.
If the property is not situated on a publicly dedicated and maintained street, then it must be
situated on a street that is community owned and maintained, or privately owned and
maintained.
There must be adequate vehicular access and there must be an adequate and legally
enforceable agreement for vehicular access and maintenance. See B4-1.3-04, Site Section of
the Appraisal Report, for additional information about privately maintained streets.
Mortgages secured by existing manufactured homes that have incomplete items, such as a
partially completed addition or renovation, or defects or needed repairs that aﬀect safety,
soundness, or structural integrity, are not eligible for purchase until the necessary work is
completed.
Exceptions to the foregoing may be made only for minor items that do not aﬀect the ability to
obtain an occupancy permit — such as landscaping, a driveway, or a walkway – subject to all
requirements and warranties for new or proposed construction provided in B4-1.2-05,
Requirements for Verifying Completion and Postponed Improvements.
Manufactured homes that have an addition or have had a structural modiﬁcation are eligible
under certain conditions. If the state in which the property is located requires inspection by a
state agency to approve modiﬁcations to the property, then the lender is required to conﬁrm
that the property has met the requirement. However, if the state does not have this
requirement, then the structural modiﬁcation must be inspected and be deemed structurally
sound by a third party who is regulated by the state and is qualiﬁed to make the
determination. In all cases, the satisfactory inspection report must be retained in the
mortgage loan ﬁle.
MH Advantage Property Eligibility Requirements
MH Advantage is manufactured housing that is built to meet construction, architectural design, and energy eﬃciency standards that are more consistent with site-built homes.
Examples of the physical characteristics for MH Advantage include
speciﬁc architectural and aesthetic features such as distinctive roof treatments (eaves and higher pitch rooﬂine), lower proﬁle foundation, garages or carports, porches, and dormers;
construction elements including durability features, such as durable siding materials; and
energy eﬃciency standards (minimum energy ratings apply).
Published February 5, 2025
245
Fannie Mae has agreements with manufacturers of homes intended to qualify for MH Advantage based on speciﬁc design criteria. The agreement allows the manufacturers to apply an MH Advantage Sticker to multi- width manufactured homes that meet the design criteria. With the exception of the lender requirements outlined below, lenders will not be required to independently determine the property’s eligibility for MH Advantage.
Note: Single-width manufactured homes are not eligible for MH Advantage.
Lenders’ and appraisers’ responsibilities relating to MH Advantage loans are detailed below.
Requirements
The lender must
ensure the property meets the MH Advantage
requirements by reviewing appraisal photos evidencing
the presence of the MH Advantage Sticker (placed in
proximity to the HUD Data Plate), and either the HUD Data
Plate or the HUD Certiﬁcation Label(s) for existing
construction. (Both are required for new construction.)
verify through appraisal, Appraisal Update and/or
Completion Report (Form 1004D), completion alternatives,

⚬ the presence of a driveway leading to the home (or to
the garage or carport, if one is present). The driveway
must consist of blacktop, pavers, bricks, concrete, cement,
Lender
or gravel (gravel must have a minimum depth of four
inches), and;
⚬ the presence of a sidewalk connecting either the
driveway, or a detached garage or carport, to a door or
attached porch of the home. The sidewalk must consist of
blacktop, pavers, ﬂagstone, bricks, concrete, or cement.
For new construction, the lender is responsible for
compliance with Fannie Mae’s standard appraisal
requirements, speciﬁcally B4-1.2-05, Requirements for
Verifying Completion and Postponed Improvements and,
B4-1.4-01, Factory-Built Housing: Manufactured Housing
for appraisals based on plans and speciﬁcations. This will
ensure site improvements that are not attached to the
home, such as detached garages, are complete.

Requirements
Standard valuation requirements for manufactured homes
apply, including:
B4-1.3-05, Improvements Section of the Appraisal Report

showing all driveways, sidewalks, and detached structures
located on the site.
Note: The requirement of photos of either the HUD Data
Plate or the HUD Certiﬁcation Label(s) applies to existing
construction. (Both are required for new construction.)
Unless stated otherwise, loans secured by manufactured homes that meet the MH Advantage criteria are subject to the same requirements that apply to all manufactured homes. (References to “manufactured homes” or “manufactured housing” apply to MH Advantage unless an exception is stated.)
Note that loans secured by MH Advantage properties are aﬀorded a number of ﬂexibilities over standard manufactured housing, including higher LTV ratios, standard mortgage insurance, and reduced loan-level price adjustments. See the Eligibility Matrix, B7-1-02, Mortgage Insurance Coverage Requirements, and Loan-Level Price Adjustment Matrix, respectively, for additional information.
Modular, Prefabricated, Panelized, or Sectional Housing Eligibility
Modular Homes. Fannie Mae purchases loans secured by modular homes built in accordance with the International Residential Code administered by state agencies responsible for adopting and administering building code requirements for the state in which the modular home is installed.
Prefabricated, Panelized, and Sectional Homes. Loans secured by prefabricated, panelized, or sectional housing are eligible for purchase. These properties do not have to satisfy HUD’s Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards or the International Residential Codes that are adopted and administered by the state in which the home is installed. The home must conform to local building codes in the area in which it will be located.
Modular, Prefabricated, Panelized, or Sectional Housing Requirements
Factory-built housing such as modular, prefabricated, panelized, or sectional housing is not considered manufactured housing and is eligible under the guidelines for one-unit properties. These types of properties
Published February 5, 2025
247
must
be built of the same quality of materials as and assume the characteristics of site-built housing,
be legally classiﬁed as real property, and
conform to all local building codes in the jurisdiction in which they are permanently located.
The purchase, conveyance, and ﬁnancing (or reﬁnancing) must be evidenced by a valid and enforceable ﬁrst- lien mortgage or deed of trust that is recorded in the land records, and must represent a single real estate transaction under applicable state law. The lender is responsible for perfecting the real estate title and obtaining any needed title endorsements before selling the loan to Fannie Mae when a unit is titled as personal property similarly to manufactured homes.
All factory-built units must be permanently attached to a foundation that meets the standards for local building codes where the unit will be placed and in accordance with the recommendations prescribed by the unit’s manufacturer (when applicable). If the unit had axles, wheels, tow hitch, or other hardware to facilitate ease of transportation to the site, the lender is responsible for ensuring that all such hardware is removed prior to selling the loan to Fannie Mae.
Fannie Mae aﬀords modular, prefabricated, panelized, or sectional housing homes the same treatment as site- built housing. Therefore, Fannie Mae does not have minimum requirements for width, size, roof pitch, or any other speciﬁc construction details.
Modular Construction Techniques on Multi-Unit Buildings
Multi-unit buildings such as condos, co-ops, and townhomes may be constructed, in whole or in part, through the use of modular construction techniques. All buildings must conform to local building codes in the jurisdiction in which they are permanently located. Units in these buildings are provided the same treatment as units in multi-unit buildings constructed with site-built techniques.

Introduction This topic contains information on leasehold estates, including:
Leasehold Estates Deﬁnitions General Requirements for Leasehold Mortgages Lease Requirements Borrower's Option to Purchase Fee Interest Exceptions to Leasehold Requirements
Leasehold Estates
Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes loans that are secured by properties subject to leasehold estates in areas in which this type of property ownership has received market acceptance.
Eligible property types are:
one- to four-unit properties,
condo units,
co-op units,
PUD units,
manufactured homes located in a condo or PUD project approved by Fannie Mae's Project Review Eligibility Service (PERS). See B4-2.2-06, Project Eligibility Review Service (PERS).
A loan secured by a unit in a project that is subject to a ground lease is considered a loan secured by a leasehold estate for purposes of this topic. For these loans, lenders must also comply with all legal and eligibility requirements for condos, co-ops, and PUDs. See Chapter B4-2, Project Standards, for additional information.
Deﬁnitions
Published February 5, 2025
249
The following deﬁnitions apply to this topic:
A loan secured by a leasehold estate is also known as a "leasehold mortgage." The term "lease" includes any form of lease or ground lease (for example, a master lease, business lease, sublease, or unit lease), together with any addendum, amendment, or rider, or a memorandum thereof. The terms "lessor" and "lessee" includes sublessor and sublessee. For loans secured by units in projects subject to a ground lease:
The borrower may also be called the "unit lessee," "unit mortgagor," or "unit owner." The "ground lease" may also be called a "land lease" or "underlying lease." For co-ops, this topic does not apply to a borrower's "proprietary lease" or "occupancy agreement." For a loan secured by a unit in a project, the term "lender" does not refer to the project's blanket lender or blanket mortgagee, if applicable.
General Requirements for Leasehold Mortgages
The lender must comply with all requirements for leasehold mortgages. In addition, the lender agrees that in accordance with A2-2-07, Life-of-Loan Representations and Warranties, any failure to comply at any time with requirements in this topic is a breach of the life-of-loan representations and warranties if it impacts ﬁrst-lien enforceability.
The following table provides general requirements for leasehold mortgages.
✓
Requirements for Leasehold Mortgages
The loan must be secured by a ﬁrst lien in the property improvements and the borrower's
rights in the leasehold interest in the land.
For co-op share loans, see B4-2.3-03, Legal Requirements for Co-op Projects and B4-2.3-04,
Loan Eligibility for Co-op Share Loans.
Note: For loans sold to Fannie Mae with new leases entered into on or after Sept. 01, 2025:
The fee estate must not be subject to any prior secured loans or other liens, unless the
secured party or lienholder has agreed to recognize and not disturb the lease if it becomes the
owner of the fee estate, as evidenced by an agreement recorded in the appropriate land
records.
The lease estate and the improvements must constitute real property and be subject to the
mortgage lien.
For co-op share loans, see B4-2.3-03, Legal Requirements for Co-op Projects.
The appraisal must meet the requirements in B4-1.4-05, Leasehold Interests Appraisal
Requirements.
The loan must meet the applicable title insurance requirements in B7-2-04, Special Title
Insurance Coverage Considerations.
Published February 5, 2025

✓
Requirements for Leasehold Mortgages
All rents, other payments, or assessments under the lease that have become due must be
paid.
The lease must not be in default under any provision of the lease and the lessor must not
have claimed any such default.
The lease must be recorded in the appropriate land records.
The lease must be in full force and eﬀect, and enforceable in all respects.
Lease Requirements
The lender must ensure all leases associated with the subject property, regardless of the form of the lease (including a master lease, sublease, or unit lease) comply with the requirements below. The lessee (or sublessee, when applicable) must be the borrower, condo or PUD homeowners' association (HOA) or the co-op corporation. For manufactured homes located in a condo or PUD project approved by PERS, the HOA must be the lessee without any further sublessees.
Compliance with these lease requirements may be satisﬁed by:
separate agreement(s) incorporated into the lease (e.g., addendum, amendment, or rider), or the project's constituent documents (project documents) (e.g., for co-ops, the Recognition Agreement or other agreement).
Note: For units in projects subject to a ground lease in which the HOA or co-op corporation is the lessee, the lender must ensure the lease complies with these lease requirements unless the project has been approved by Fannie Mae in Condo Project Manager (CPM).
Regardless of the lessee, the lender must ensure the terms of the lease address all of the following:
The lease must have an unexpired term that exceeds the maturity date of the loan by ﬁve (5) years or more. The lease must not preclude the borrower's membership or voting rights in the HOA or co-op corporation, as applicable. If the loan is secured by a sublease, a default under the master lease will not automatically result in the termination of the sublease.
The following table provides additional lease requirements depending on whether the borrower or the HOA or co-op corporation is the lessee.
Published February 5, 2025
251
Lease Requirements if the Borrower is the Lessee
The lease must allow the lease for it (including the lessee's
option to purchase) to be assigned, transferred, mortgaged,
and subleased an unlimited number of times either without
restriction or on payment of a reasonable fee and delivery of
reasonable documentation to the lessor. The lease must not
require a credit review or impose other qualifying criteria on
any assignee, transferee, mortgagee, or sublessee.
The lease may include the following restrictions, if
applicable:
requirements related to Bureau of Indian Aﬀairs (BIA) for
leasehold mortgages on tribal lands, including approval of
BIA and lessor.
limitations in accordance and compliance with .B5-5.2-01,
Loans With Resale Restrictions: General Information
The lease must provide protection of the lender's ﬁnancial
interests in the event of a condemnation or similar taking
proceeding.
Note: If the lease provisions are silent or insuﬃcient, the
lender may rely on applicable state law or other written
agreement that provides substantially the same protections.
The lease must not include any default provisions that could
result in forfeiture or termination of the lease, unless the
lease provides the lender with:
the right to receive notice of any lessee default under the
lease, and
at least 30 days, at the lender's option, to either cure the
default, take over the lessee's rights under the lease, or
commence foreclosure.
Note: If the property is located in Maryland, it is exempt
from this requirement if applicable state law provides for the
registration of residential leases with the state and requires
the lessor to send written notice of default under the lease to
the lender at least 30 days prior to the lessor ﬁling an action
for possession.
Published February 5, 2025
Lease Requirements if the HOA or Co-op Corporation is the Lessee
No lease requirements relating to
assignments, transfers, subleases or
mortgages.
See B4-2.2-03, Full Review: Additional
Eligibility Requirements for Units in New
and Newly Converted Condo Projects
and B4-2.3-03, Legal Requirements for
Co-op Projects.
The lease or project documents must
provide that the lender receives notice of
any lessee default under the lease not
more than 30 days after such default,
and at least 30 days' prior notice of
termination of the ground lease.
252
Lease Requirements if the Borrower is the Lessee
Lease Requirements if the HOA or Co-op Corporation is the Lessee
The lease must not include any provisions that allow the
leasehold estate to be extinguished or otherwise impaired by
any merger of title between the lessor and lessee without the
lender's prior consent.
No lease requirements relating to
extinguishment or impairment of the
lessee's leasehold estate.
Borrower's Option to Purchase Fee Interest
The lease may, but is not required to, include an option for the borrower to purchase the fee interest in the land. If the option is included, the purchase must be at the borrower’s sole option, and there can be no time limit within which the option must be exercised. If the option to purchase the fee title is exercised, the mortgage must become a lien on the fee title with the same degree of priority that it had on the leasehold. Both the lease and the option to purchase must be assignable, together, subject to permissible restrictions noted above.
The following table provides requirements for establishing the purchase price of the land.

of the total appraised value). If the current appraised
value is $225,000, $50,000 for land and $175,000 for
improvements, the purchase price would be $50,000
(the current appraised value of the land, because it is
less than 25% of $225,000).
Note: If the lease is tied to an external index, the
initial land value may not exceed 40% of the
combined appraised value of the land and
improvements.
Exceptions to Leasehold Requirements
Leasehold estates granted by community land trusts and high LTV reﬁnance loans secured by leasehold estates are not subject to the requirements in this topic.

Accessory Dwelling Units Multiple Parcels Mixed-Use Properties Hawaiian Lava Zones Properties with Solar Panels
Accessory Dwelling Units
An ADU is typically an additional living area independent of the primary dwelling that may have been added to, created within, or detached from a primary one-unit dwelling. The ADU must provide for living, sleeping, cooking, and bathroom facilities and be on the same parcel as the primary one-unit dwelling.
The following table describes the requirements for classifying an ADU.
✓
Requirements
Only one ADU is permitted on the parcel of the primary one-unit dwelling.
ADUs are not permitted with a two- to four-unit dwelling.
The ADU must
⚬ be subordinate in size to the primary dwelling.
⚬ have the following separate features from the primary dwelling:
▪ means of ingress/egress,
▪ kitchen,
▪ sleeping area,
▪ bathing area, and
▪ bathroom facilities.
The ADU may, but is not required to, include access to the primary dwelling. However, it is not
considered an ADU if it can only be accessed through the primary dwelling or the area is open to
the primary dwelling with no expectation of privacy.
Published February 5, 2025
255
✓
Requirements
The kitchen must, at a minimum, contain the following:
⚬ cabinets;
⚬ a countertop;
⚬ a sink with running water; and
⚬ a stove or stove hookup (hotplates, microwaves, or toaster ovens are not acceptable stove
substitutes).
An independent second kitchen by itself does not constitute an ADU.
The removal of a stove does not change the ADU classiﬁcation.
A borrower must qualify for the mortgage without considering any rental income from the ADU.
(See B3-3.1-08, Rental Income for further information, and B5-6-02, HomeReady Mortgage
Underwriting Methods and Requirements for an exception for HomeReady mortgage loans.)
Construction of an ADU
The construction method of an ADU can be site- or factory-built, including modular, and single- or multi-width HUD Code manufactured homes that are legally classiﬁed as real property. If an ADU is present, the primary dwelling must be site-built or a modular home. If the ADU is a HUD Code manufactured home, the lender must verify the following:
the property was built in compliance with the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (established June 15, 1976, as amended and in force at the time the home was manufactured),
it is attached to a permanent foundation system in accordance with the manufacturer’s requirements for anchoring, support, stability, and maintenance,
the foundation system must be appropriate for the soil conditions for the site and meet local and state codes,
it is encumbered by the mortgage with the primary dwelling, and
additional requirements that appear in HUD regulations in 24 C.F.R. Part 3280.
Compliance with these standards will be evidenced by photos of the HUD Data Plate or HUD Certiﬁcation Label(s) (for each section of the home) in the appraisal. If the original or alternative documentation cannot be obtained for the HUD Data Plate or the HUD Certiﬁcation Label(s), the loan is not eligible for sale to Fannie Mae. See B2-3-02, Special Property Eligibility and Underwriting Considerations: Factory-Built Housing, for more information.
Examples of ADUs
Examples of ADUs include, (but are not limited to):
a living area over a garage,
a living area in a basement,
Published February 5, 2025
256
a small addition to the primary dwelling, or
a manufactured home (legally classiﬁed as real property).
Whether a property is deﬁned as a one-unit property with an accessory unit or a two- to four-unit property will be based on the characteristics of the property, which may include, but are not limited to, the existence of separate utility meter(s), a unique postal address, and whether the unit can be legally rented. The appraiser must determine compliance with this deﬁnition as part of the analysis in the Highest and Best Use section of the appraisal. See B4-1.3-05, Improvements Section of the Appraisal Report for additional ADU appraisal requirements.
Zoning for an ADU
Some ADUs may predate the adoption of the local zoning ordinance and therefore be classiﬁed as legal nonconforming. An ADU should always be considered legal if it is allowed under the current zoning code for the subject property.
If it is determined that the property contains an ADU that is not allowed under zoning (where an ADU is not allowed under any circumstance), the property is eligible under the following additional conditions:
The lender conﬁrms that the existence will not jeopardize any future property insurance claim that might need to be ﬁled for the property.
The appraisal requirements related to zoning for an ADU are met. See B4-1.3-05, Improvements Section of the Appraisal Report
Multiple Parcels
The table below provides the requirements when the security property consists of more than one parcel of real estate.
✓
Multiple Parcels Requirements
Each parcel must be conveyed in its entirety.
Parcels must be adjoined to the other, unless they comply with the following exception.
Parcels that otherwise would be adjoined, but are divided by a road, are acceptable if the
parcel without a residence is a non-buildable lot (for example, waterfront properties where the
parcel without the residence provides access to the water). Evidence that the lot is non-
buildable must be included in the loan ﬁle.
Each parcel must have the same basic zoning (for example, residential, agricultural).
Published February 5, 2025
257
✓
Multiple Parcels Requirements
The entire property may contain only one dwelling unit. Limited additional non-residential
improvements, such as a garage, are acceptable. For example, the adjoining parcel may not
have an additional dwelling unit. An improvement that has been built across lot lines is
acceptable. For example, a home built across both parcels where the lot line runs under the
home is acceptable.
The mortgage must be a valid ﬁrst lien that covers each parcel.
Mixed-Use Properties
Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes mortgages that are secured by properties that have a business use in addition to their residential use, such as a property with space set aside for a day care facility, a beauty or barber shop, or a doctor’s oﬃce.
The following special eligibility criteria must be met:
The property must be a one-unit dwelling that the borrower occupies as a principal residence.
The borrower must be both the owner and the operator of the business.
The property must be primarily residential in nature.
The dwelling may not be modiﬁed in a manner that has an adverse impact on its marketability as a residential property.
See B4-1.4-07, Mixed-Use Property Appraisal Requirements, for appraisal considerations.
Hawaiian Lava Zones
Fannie Mae will only purchase or securitize mortgage loans secured by properties that are located within lava zones 3 through 9 on the island of Hawaii. Properties in lava zones 1 and 2 are not eligible due to the increased risk of property destruction from lava ﬂows within these areas.
Hawaiian lava ﬂow maps and other information are available online at the U.S. Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory website.
Properties with Solar Panels
The ownership and debt ﬁnancing structures commonly found with solar panels are key to determining whether the panels are third-party owned, personal property of the homeowner, or a ﬁxture to the real estate. Common ownership or ﬁnancing structures include:
borrower-owned panels,
Published February 5, 2025
258
leasing agreements,
separately ﬁnanced solar panels (where the panels serve as collateral for debt distinct from any existing mortgage); or
power purchase agreements.
Fannie Mae will purchase or securitize a mortgage loan on a property with solar panels. If the borrower is, or will be, the owner of the solar panels (meaning the panels were a cash purchase, were included in the home purchase price, were otherwise ﬁnanced and repaid in full, or are secured by the existing ﬁrst mortgage), our standard requirements apply (for example, appraisal, insurance, and title).
Properties with solar panels and other energy eﬃcient items ﬁnanced with a PACE loan are not eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae if the PACE loan is not paid in full prior to or at closing. For additional information, see B5-3.4-01, Property Assessed Clean Energy Loans.
Lenders are responsible for determining the ownership and any ﬁnancing structure of the subject property’s solar panels in order to properly underwrite the loan and maintain ﬁrst lien position of the mortgage. When ﬁnancing is involved, lenders may be able to make this determination by evaluating the borrower’s credit report for solar-related debt and by asking the borrower for a copy of all related documentation for the loan. The lender must also review the title report to determine if the related debt is reﬂected in the land records associated with the subject property. If insuﬃcient documentation is available and the ownership status of the panels is unclear, no value for the panels may be attributed to the property value on the appraisal unless the lender obtains a UCC “personal property” search that conﬁrms the solar panels are not claimed as collateral by any non-mortgage lender.
Note: A Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) ﬁnancing statement that covers personal property and is not intended as a “ﬁxture ﬁling” must be ﬁled in the oﬃce identiﬁed in the relevant state’s adopted version of the UCC.
Lenders are responsible for ensuring the appraiser has accurate information about the ownership structure of the solar panels and that the appraisal appropriately addresses any impact to the property’s value. Separately ﬁnanced solar panels must not contribute to the value of the property unless the related documents indicate the panels cannot be repossessed in the event of default on the associated ﬁnancing. Any contributory value for owned or ﬁnanced solar panels must comply with Energy Eﬃciency Improvements in B4-1.3-05, Improvements Section of the Appraisal Report .
The following table summarizes some of the speciﬁc underwriting criteria that must be applied depending on the details of any non-mortgage ﬁnancing for the solar panels.

It is ﬁled in the same oﬃce that mortgages are recorded under the law of the state in which the real property is located. Filing in the land records provides notice to third parties, including title insurance companies, of the existence and perfection of a security interest in the ﬁxture. If properly ﬁled, the security interest in the described ﬁxture has priority over the lien of a subsequently recorded mortgage.
If the solar panels are leased from or owned by a third party under a power purchase agreement or other similar lease arrangement, the following requirements apply (whether to the original agreement or as subsequently amended).

Lender Requirements for Properties with Solar Panels that are Leased or Covered by a Power Purchase Agreement
The lender must obtain and review copies of the lease or power purchase agreement.
The monthly lease payment must be included in the DTI ratio calculation unless the lease is
structured to
provide delivery of a speciﬁc amount of energy at a ﬁxed payment during a given period,
and
have a production guarantee that compensates the borrower on a prorated basis in the
event the solar panels fail to meet the energy output required for in the lease for that period.
Payments under power purchase agreements where the payment is calculated solely based on
the energy produced may be excluded from the DTI ratio.
The value of the solar panels cannot be included in the appraised value of the property.
The value of the solar panels must not be included in the LTV ratio calculation, even if a
precautionary UCC ﬁling is recorded because the documented lease or power purchase
agreement status takes priority.
Note: A “precautionary” UCC ﬁling is one that lessors often ﬁle to put third parties on notice
of their claimed ownership interest in the property described in it. When the only property
described in the UCC ﬁling as collateral is the solar equipment covered by the lease or power
purchase agreement, and not the home or underlying land, such a precautionary UCC ﬁling is
acceptable (and a minor impediment to title), as long as the loan is underwritten in
accordance with this topic.
The value of the solar panels must not be included in other debt secured by real estate in the
CLTV ratio calculation because the documented lease or power purchase agreement status
takes priority.

Lender Requirements for Properties with Solar Panels that are Leased or Covered by a Power Purchase Agreement
The property must maintain access to an alternate source of electric power that meets
community standards.
The lease or power purchase agreement must indicate that
any damage that occurs as a result of installation, malfunction, manufacturing defect, or the
removal of the solar panels is the responsibility of the owner of the equipment and the owner
must be obligated to repair the damage and return the improvements to their original or prior
condition (for example, sound and watertight conditions that are architecturally consistent
with the home);
the owner of the solar panels agrees not to be named loss payee (or named insured) on the
property owner’s property insurance policy covering the residential structure on which the
panels are attached. As an alternative to this requirement, the lender may verify that the
owner of the solar panels is not a named loss payee (or named insured) on the property
owner’s property insurance policy; and
in the event of foreclosure, the lender or assignee has the discretion to
⚬ terminate the lease/agreement and require the third-party owner to remove the
equipment;
⚬ become, without payment of any transfer or similar fee, the beneﬁciary of the borrower’s
lease/agreement with the third party; or
⚬ enter into a new lease/agreement with the third party, under terms no less favorable than
the prior owner.
Any exceptions to coverage on the title insurance policy for recorded instruments relating to
the solar panels must comply with B7-2-05, Title Exceptions and Impediments.

B2-3-05, Properties Aﬀected by a Disaster (03/01/2023)
Introduction This topic contains information on properties aﬀected by a disaster, including:
Overview Property Eligibility Requirements Value Acceptance Oﬀers Following a Disaster Age of Documentation Requirements
Overview
The Mortgage Selling and Servicing Contract requires the lender to warrant for each loan it delivers to Fannie Mae that the property is not damaged by ﬁre, wind, or other cause of loss and that there are no proceedings pending for the partial or total condemnation of the property. The lender also warrants that the loan conforms to all applicable requirements in the Selling Guide, including the requirement that the loan is an acceptable investment. Finally, the lender represents and warrants that it knows of nothing involving the loan or the property that can reasonably be expected to cause the loan to become delinquent or adversely aﬀect the mortgage's value or marketability.
Property Eligibility Requirements
The lender must be able to make the warranties that are described above. Therefore, before delivery of a loan to Fannie Mae where the property may have been damaged by a disaster, the lender is expected to take prudent and reasonable actions to determine whether the condition of the property may have materially changed. The lender is responsible for determining if an inspection of the property and/or new appraisal is necessary to support this warranty. If a property is located in a condo or co-op project, both the condition of the unit and the condition of the building in which the unit is located must be assessed.
Lenders should use the following criteria when determining if the loan can be delivered to Fannie Mae:
If the property has been damaged and the damage does not aﬀect the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the property and the repair items are covered by insurance, the lender may deliver the loan to Fannie Mae. In these circumstances, the lender must obtain documentation of the professional estimates of the repair costs and must ensure that suﬃcient funds are available for the borrower's beneﬁt to guarantee the completion of the repairs.
If the property was damaged and the damage is uninsured or the damage aﬀects the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the property, the property must be repaired before the loan is delivered to Fannie Mae.
Published February 5, 2025
263
These requirements are necessary to support the lender’s property representations and warranties, and apply through the end of the delivery process which is the whole loan purchase date or MBS settlement date. For DU loan caseﬁles with a value acceptance (appraisal waiver) or value acceptance + property data oﬀer, the lender may exercise the oﬀer as long as they have complied with the above requirements with regard to property condition and repairs. This applies in addition to the value acceptance requirements in B4-1.4-10, Value Acceptance (Appraisal Waiver) and B4-1.4-11, Value Acceptance + Property Data.
Note: The above requirements do not apply to high LTV reﬁnance loans. See B5-7-02, High LTV Reﬁnance Underwriting, Documentation, and Collateral Requirements for the New Loan for additional information. For delivered loan requirements, see the Servicing Guide, Chapter D1-3.
DU is updated periodically to incorporate ZIP codes included in FEMA-Declared Disaster Areas eligible for Individual Assistance. Fannie Mae may also add areas impacted by other disasters or emergencies at its discretion. New loan caseﬁles for properties in those ZIP codes are excluded from consideration for a new value acceptance (appraisal waiver) or value acceptance + property data oﬀer.
Value Acceptance Oﬀers Following a Disaster
After Fannie Mae has received an acceptable appraisal that was performed following a disaster, that appraisal can serve as the basis for a future value acceptance (appraisal waiver) or value acceptance + property data oﬀer. Lenders may exercise these oﬀers in accordance with the requirements in B4-1.4-10, Value Acceptance (Appraisal Waiver) and B4-1.4-11, Value Acceptance + Property Data.
Age of Documentation Requirements
When a loan is secured by a property located in a FEMA-Declared Disaster Area eligible for individual assistance, Fannie Mae provides additional ﬂexibilities. The following requirements apply:
The underwriting documentation, including credit reports and veriﬁcations of income and assets, must be dated no more than 180 days before the note date.
Lenders may disregard the message in the DU Underwriting Findings Report that indicates if the loan caseﬁles has not already closed, the credit report has expired.
The appraisal must be dated no more than 180 days before the note date. Lenders must comply with the property eligibility requirements above.
Lenders who wish to receive representation and warranty relief oﬀered by the DU validation service must continue to comply with all conditions in the DU Underwriting Findings Report, including the close by date.
Loans originated in accordance with the age of documentation ﬂexibilities, must be delivered to Fannie Mae no later than two years from the date of the disaster declaration by FEMA.
See B5-4.2-02, Disaster-Related Limited Cash-Out Reﬁnance Flexibilities for information related to certain ﬂexibilities oﬀered for a disaster related limited cash-out transaction.

Subpart B3, Underwriting Borrowers
Introduction
This subpart contains borrower underwriting policies for conventional mortgage loans that are sold to Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae oﬀers lenders two options for conducting a comprehensive risk assessment–automated underwriting through DU or manual underwriting. Both methods include an evaluation of the borrower’s equity investment, credit history, liquid reserves, reliable and recurring income, and the cumulative eﬀect that these and other risk factors have on mortgage loan performance.

Overview
Fannie Mae’s underwriting policies include an evaluation of the borrower’s (or spouse’s to the extent required by applicable law) equity investment, credit history, liquid reserves, reliable and recurring income, and the cumulative eﬀect that these and other risk factors have on mortgage loan performance. Fannie Mae’s underwriting policies enable the lender to consider various scenarios in evaluating a borrower’s willingness and capacity to repay the mortgage loan. The lender must conﬁrm that information provided by the borrower during the loan application process is accurate and complete; include documentation in the loan ﬁle that supports the lender’s assessment of the borrower’s credit history, employment and income, assets, and other ﬁnancial information used for qualifying; conduct a comprehensive risk assessment of each mortgage loan application; and render a decision to either approve or decline the mortgage loan application.
Fannie Mae oﬀers lenders two options for conducting a comprehensive risk assessment–automated underwriting through DU or manual underwriting. Both methods include an evaluation of the borrower’s equity investment, credit history, liquid reserves, reliable and recurring income, and the cumulative eﬀect that these and other risk factors have on mortgage loan performance.
Lenders that choose to manually underwrite a mortgage application are expected to follow the comprehensive risk assessment approach. Under this approach, lenders evaluate certain key risk elements to assess the overall level of delinquency risk.
Lenders are fully responsible for:
evaluating the delinquency risk of each loan;
reviewing the credit report, as well as all other credit information, to determine that the credit report meets Fannie Mae’s requirements, that the data evaluated was accurate, and that the borrower has the capacity to repay the mortgage loan;
assessing the adequacy of the property as collateral for the mortgage requested;
determining whether or not the loan meets Fannie Mae's eligibility requirements as fully described in this Guide;
determining whether or not it is appropriate to deliver the mortgage loan to Fannie Mae; and
fully documenting the assessment and the documentation on which the assessment was based.
Comprehensive Risk Assessment
Lenders must evaluate the overall level of serious delinquency risk that is present in each mortgage application by taking into consideration any layering of risk factors, the signiﬁcance of risk factors, and the overall risks present in the mortgage application. The Eligibility Matrix provides a solid foundation for assessing the risk of a manually underwritten loan, and identiﬁes the risk elements to evaluate for each transaction type, including:
LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios (“LTV ratios”);
credit score;
Published February 5, 2025
266
occupancy;
loan purpose;
loan amortization type;
property type and number of units;
product type (if applicable);
debt-to-income (DTI) ratio; and
ﬁnancial reserves.
For example, the purchase of a single unit principal residence must have LTV ratios no higher than 95%, a credit score of at least 680, and a DTI ratio no greater than 36%. If the DTI ratio is greater than 36% but less than 45%, a higher credit score is required. But if the LTV ratios are less than 75%, a credit score as low as 620 is permitted.
The lender's determination of the mortgage delinquency risk, the assessment of the adequacy of the property as security for the mortgage, the determination of whether the mortgage satisﬁes Fannie Mae's mortgage eligibility criteria, and the acceptability of the documentation in the mortgage ﬁle should all enter into the decision on whether to deliver the mortgage to Fannie Mae.
The lender must fully document the results of its comprehensive risk assessment and ﬁnal underwriting decision, and ensure that the information used to reach its comprehensive risk assessment is valid, accurate, and substantiated.
For a more precise or deﬁnitive recommendation for determining whether to deliver a given mortgage to Fannie Mae, the lender should submit the mortgage application to DU. DU evaluates the probability of future serious delinquency and arrives at an underwriting recommendation by relying on a comprehensive examination of risk factors in a mortgage application. Furthermore, DU is the standard by which Fannie Mae assesses the delinquency risk on all mortgages sold to Fannie Mae.

Both methods include an evaluation of the borrower’s equity investment, credit history, liquid reserves, reliable and recurring income, and the cumulative eﬀect that these and other risk factors have on mortgage loan performance.
DU evaluates mortgage delinquency risk and arrives at an underwriting recommendation by relying on a comprehensive examination of the primary and contributory risk factors in a mortgage application. (See B3-2-03, Risk Factors Evaluated by DU) It analyzes the information in the loan caseﬁle to reach an overall credit risk assessment to determine eligibility for delivery to Fannie Mae.
No one factor determines a borrower’s ability or willingness to make their mortgage payments. DU identiﬁes low-risk factors that can oﬀset high-risk factors. When several high-risk factors are present in a loan caseﬁle without suﬃcient oﬀsets, the likelihood of serious delinquency increases.
DU conducts its analysis uniformly, and without regard to race, gender, or other prohibited factors. DU uses validated, statistically signiﬁcant variables that have been shown to be predictive of mortgage delinquency across all groups.
DU does not evaluate a loan’s compliance with federal and state laws and regulations including, without limitation, a loan’s potential status as a qualiﬁed mortgage under applicable laws and regulations. Lenders bear sole responsibility for complying with applicable laws and regulations, and these compliance obligations may not be imposed upon or shared by Fannie Mae.

Underwriting with DU
Lenders must enter loan data (including data from the Form 1003) in their loan origination system or in the DU user interface before submitting for underwriting. A credit report must also be obtained. Loans may be submitted to DU before or after the closing of the mortgage loan; however, the ﬁrst submission to DU for underwriting purposes must occur before closing of the mortgage loan.
When the mortgage loan or borrower information changes and it no longer matches the information used when the loan caseﬁle was last underwritten with DU, the lender must update the data and resubmit the loan caseﬁle to DU. Exceptions are speciﬁed in B3-2-10, Accuracy of DU Data, DU Tolerances, and Errors in the Credit Report.
When the loan caseﬁle is resubmitted to DU after closing and prior to delivery to Fannie Mae, the lender is responsible for ensuring that:
all information provided in the ﬁnal submission to DU matches the terms of the closed loan;
the loan complies with the requirements speciﬁed in A2-2-04, Limited Waiver and Enforcement Relief of Representations and Warranties;
the loan delivery data matches both the closed loan and the ﬁnal data submitted to DU; and
the loan caseﬁle receives an eligible recommendation from DU on the ﬁnal submission.
The lender may request a new credit report after closing when the loan caseﬁle is resubmitted and, as with all loan caseﬁles, must comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act with regard to the purpose and nature of the inquiry. If the new credit report contains information that is diﬀerent than the information used to prepare the ﬁnal loan application that was signed by the borrower at closing, the loan application must be updated. (Borrower signature(s) are not required due to the update occurring post-closing.) The lender must include both the ﬁnal signed and the updated unsigned loan applications in the loan ﬁle.
Note: The credit report must meet the allowable age of documents as of the note date. If the credit report expired prior to the note date and the loan caseﬁle is being resubmitted to DU, a new credit report must be requested.
In certain instances, the lender may not be able to access the original DU loan caseﬁle for resubmission purposes. Lenders may create a new loan caseﬁle in DU after closing to ensure that all information in the ﬁnal DU submission matches the terms of the closed loan, provided all of the following conditions are met:
the above lender responsibilities are met, including the updating of the ﬁnal loan application, if applicable;
the loan has not yet been delivered to Fannie Mae;
the loan has the same information (for example, the same borrower(s) and property) as had previously been underwritten through DU prior to closing using another loan caseﬁle, and that loan caseﬁle received an eligible recommendation from DU;
the lender retains the DU Underwriting Findings Report from the original loan caseﬁle ID in the loan ﬁle;
the DU submission using the new loan caseﬁle occurs no more than 60 days after closing (based on the note date) or 12 months after initial closing for single-closing construction-to-permanent loans (described in B5-3.1-02, Conversion of Construction-to-Permanent Financing: Single-Closing Transactions); and
Published February 5, 2025
269
as stated above, when a new credit report is requested, the lender complies with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
If the resubmission to DU results in an “ineligible” recommendation, the mortgage loan may not be delivered to Fannie Mae.
Note: If the quality control function is performed before delivery, the above requirements apply. If quality control is performed after delivery, see D1-3-03, Lender Post-Closing Quality Control Review of Data Integrity .
DU Underwriting Reports
DU issues two types of reports:
The DU Underwriting Findings report summarizes the overall underwriting recommendation and lists the steps necessary for the lender to complete the processing of the loan ﬁle. This is typically the ﬁrst report viewed by an underwriter or a loan oﬃcer after the loan caseﬁle has been underwritten with DU. This report is described in B3-2-11, DU Underwriting Findings Report.
The Underwriting Analysis report contains much of the same information requested on the Uniform Underwriting and Transmittal Summary ( Form 1008).
Each time a loan caseﬁle is resubmitted to DU, the information in these reports is updated with information from the most recent submission. The date and time of each submission are recorded on each report, along with the unique loan caseﬁle ID.
Loan Caseﬁle Archival Policy
DU loan caseﬁles are archived and no longer retained in DU from the earlier of
270 days from the date on which the loan caseﬁle was last updated, or
540 days from the date on which the loan caseﬁle was created.
These time frames are intended to ensure that the total volume of loans in the system is at a manageable level, reducing the time required by DU to search for and retrieve loan caseﬁles
After a loan caseﬁle is archived from DU, it cannot be restored. If a loan caseﬁle that has been archived must be re-underwritten, a new loan caseﬁle must be created and submitted to DU. The loan caseﬁle will be subject to the policies in eﬀect for the current version of DU. Fannie Mae is not responsible for retaining loan caseﬁles for the lender.
DU Underwriting Recommendations
The following topics describe the underwriting recommendations returned by DU:
B3-2-05, Approve/Eligible Recommendations.
Published February 5, 2025
270
B3-2-06, Approve/Ineligible Recommendations.
B3-2-07, Refer with Caution Recommendations.
B3-2-08, Out of Scope Recommendations.
General Requirements for Lenders
When underwriting loans with DU, the lender must:
employ prudent underwriting judgment in assessing whether a loan caseﬁle should be approved and delivered to Fannie Mae;
conﬁrm the accuracy of the data it submits, making sure that it did not fail to submit any data that might have aﬀected the DU recommendation had it been known;
ensure that the loan complies with all of the veriﬁcation messages and approval conditions speciﬁed in the DU Underwriting Findings report;
apply due diligence when reviewing the documentation in the loan ﬁle;
review the credit report to conﬁrm that the data that DU evaluated with respect to the borrower’s credit history was accurate and complete;
determine if there is any potentially derogatory or contradictory information that is not part of the data analyzed by DU; and
take action when erroneous data in the credit report or contradictory or derogatory information in the loan ﬁle would justify additional investigation or would provide grounds for a decision that is diﬀerent from the recommendation that DU delivered.
For example, if a foreclosure was reported in the credit report but was not detected by DU (that is, it was not referenced in any veriﬁcation messages), the lender must determine if the loan complies with the applicable guidelines (see B3-5.3-07, Signiﬁcant Derogatory Credit Events — Waiting Periods and Re-establishing Credit).

General Information
The DU validation service oﬀers lenders an opportunity to deliver loans with more certainty. Certain components of the loan ﬁle – income, employment, and assets – are eligible for validation by DU using electronic veriﬁcation reports obtained from vendors. When a component of the loan is validated by DU, the loan may be eligible for representation and warranty enforcement relief related to that component. Diﬀerent lender quality control and documentation requirements may also apply. See the following for additional information:

The DU validation service is an optional service available only for conventional loans underwritten through DU. Lenders are not required to participate in the DU validation service in order for a loan to be underwritten through DU, and may not require a borrower to participate in the DU validation service.
Authorized Vendors and Veriﬁcation Reports
A lender may obtain a veriﬁcation report directly from a “report supplier” or from a “report distributor” as described below:
Report suppliers have entered into an agreement with Fannie Mae to participate in the DU validation service. Report suppliers generate the report and send the report data electronically to the DU validation service. This report reﬂects the report supplier’s name and/or logo.
Report distributors have not entered into an agreement with Fannie Mae, but have an agreement with an eligible report supplier. The report supplier (not the distributor) sends the report data electronically to the DU validation service. The veriﬁcation report reﬂects both the report distributor’s name and the name and/or logo of the applicable report supplier.
The DU Validation Service Veriﬁcation Report Vendors list provides a listing of authorized report suppliers and report distributors and is available on Fannie Mae’s website.
Asset Veriﬁcation Reports
Asset veriﬁcation reports provided by third-party vendors may include:
a 30- or 60-day report; data covering up to 12 months (or more) of asset account data; a report showing a subset of information typically found on an asset veriﬁcation report (for example, deposit transaction information with no corresponding amount or account balance) intended to be used to verify employment using direct deposit transactions (a "supplemental asset report").
To validate income or employment using an asset veriﬁcation report, the lender must order an asset veriﬁcation report with a minimum of 12 months of data from an authorized vendor.
Lender Requirements
No special approval is required from Fannie Mae to use the DU validation service, however, lenders must “opt- in” to validate income and employment using an asset veriﬁcation report.
When a lender provides the required reports, all loans that are submitted to DU will automatically be assessed through the DU validation service for validation of the related component.
To participate in the DU validation service, the lender must
have a relationship with, and have entered into a contract for the services provided by, a vendor(s) –either a report supplier or a report distributor – that is authorized to obtain a veriﬁcation report;
Published February 5, 2025
273
have an agreement with a vendor(s) that
allows for the report supplier to share the information contained within the veriﬁcation report (obtained by the lender) with Fannie Mae electronically for use by the DU validation service; and
ensures the lender receives, or has access to, the same data that is shared with Fannie Mae electronically in accordance with A2-4.1-01, Establishing Loan Files; and
establish controls to manage and monitor the vendors in accordance with its own regulatory requirements.
For loans assessed by the DU validation service, the lender must
obtain borrower authorization to receive the information from the vendor;
conﬁrm that the veriﬁcation report matches the borrower;
ensure information entered by the lender in DU is properly documented;
investigate and resolve any conﬂicting or contradictory information;
retain a copy of all veriﬁcation reports in the loan ﬁle (see A2-4.1-01, Establishing Loan Files for details), in addition to any other documentation required by DU; and
ensure that the most current version of the veriﬁcation report is used by the DU validation service. If the lender obtains an updated veriﬁcation report, the lender must resubmit the loan to DU and receive a message that the component has been validated in order for the representation and warranty enforcement relief to apply.
Validation Results
When a component of the loan ﬁle is assessed by the DU validation service, three results are possible: validated, not validated, or unable to be validated. DU will issue a message providing the validation results.

Income and employment are assessed independently; however, the results of the employment validation may impact income validation.
When employment is validated by DU, the validation satisﬁes the requirement for verbal veriﬁcation of employment described in B3-3.1-07, Verbal Veriﬁcation of Employment. Lenders must comply with all DU messages, including ensuring the loan closes by the “Close by Date” stated in the DU employment validation message.
The lender must review the veriﬁcation report relied upon by DU, including any Employer Disclaimer information, if applicable, and:
Published February 5, 2025
277
investigate and resolve any conﬂicting or contradictory information, and
when an asset veriﬁcation report is used to validate employment, the lender must conﬁrm that the borrower is listed as an owner of the asset account and that the report reﬂects the borrower's name as account holder. The lender need only review the report covering the period of time (30 or 60 days) required for asset veriﬁcation for the transaction type, or if no asset veriﬁcation is required for the transaction, the account activity covering the most recent 30-day period, for these purposes.
Verbal Veriﬁcation of Employment Alternative for Employment Validated using an Asset Veriﬁcation Report
When employment is initially validated using an asset veriﬁcation report and the loan will not close by the "Close by Date" stated in the DU employment validation message, the lender may obtain a supplemental asset report from an asset veriﬁcation report vendor and either submit it to DU or perform a manual review of the report to satisfy the verbal veriﬁcation of employment described in B3-3.1-07, Verbal Veriﬁcation of Employment.
When used to reverify employment (whether through an automated or a manual review), the supplemental asset report must contain
the account numbers and the account holder name for each account included in the report, the date of the report, and the date and deposit details of the deposits reﬂected on the report.
The lender must review the report to conﬁrm the borrower is listed as an account holder. The lender must not have any information indicating the borrower may no longer be employed and must investigate and resolve any contradictory or conﬂicting information.
When a manual review is performed, the lender must obtain the report within the same timeframe required for a verbal veriﬁcation of employment and additionally, review the report to conﬁrm
the deposit details of the direct deposits that are being used to reverify employment
match the ACH details identiﬁed in the DU ﬁndings messages for the direct deposit streams used by DU to validate employment, and are consistent with the income source provided in DU;
the pattern of receipt of the identiﬁed direct deposits used to reverify employment does not reﬂect missed payments, and the latest expected payment prior to the date of the report is present.
Note: When a lender performs a manual review of the supplemental asset report to reverify employment, the enforcement relief from representations and warranties related to the employment validation through the DU validation service described in ,A2-2-04, Limited Waiver and Enforcement Relief of Representations and Warranties does not apply.
All supplemental asset reports must be retained in the loan ﬁle.

Asset—Additional Information
The following additional information applies to asset validation:
All assets shown on the asset veriﬁcation report must be in U.S. dollars and held in a U.S. or state regulated ﬁnancial institution.
The account statements obtained from the vendor must cover the most recent:
30 days of account activity for reﬁnance transactions
60 days of account activity for purchase transactions
The most recent quarter, if account information is reported on a quarterly basis
The lender must review the veriﬁcation report (covering the account activity for the period of time required) and investigate and resolve any conﬂicting or contradictory information. The lender must also conﬁrm that the borrower is listed as an account holder for each asset account.
The DU validation service automates the assessment of large deposits on purchase transactions required in B3-4.2-02, Depository Accounts. When a large deposit needs to be documented, DU will issue a message specifying the amount of the large deposit, as well as the institution name and account number of the account that includes the large deposit. If no message is issued by DU, then no documentation of any large deposit appearing on the asset report is required when assets have been validated.
When the DU validation service validates assets on transactions with gift funds, the lender must ensure that the gift funds that appear as deposits on the asset veriﬁcation report (if any) meet the requirements in B3-4.3-04, Personal Gifts.
If the actual amount of funds required to complete the transaction is greater than the Funds Required to Close speciﬁed in DU, the lender must document liquid assets to cover the additional amount. See B3-2-10, Accuracy of DU Data, DU Tolerances, and Errors in the Credit Report for additional details on whether the loan must be resubmitted to DU.
For self-employed borrowers, if an eligible asset account is reﬂected as a business account on the veriﬁcation report, the lender must perform a business cash ﬂow analysis to conﬁrm that the withdrawal of funds for this transaction will not have a negative impact on the business. If the lender determines the withdrawal would have a negative impact on the business, the lender must remove the assets from the online loan application, obtain an updated veriﬁcation report that excludes the business account, and
Published February 5, 2025
279
resubmit the loan to DU.
When retirement assets are entered in DU, DU issues a message requiring the lender to ensure that withdrawals are permitted, and that withdrawals are not limited to those completed in connection with the borrower’s employment termination, retirement, or death. If any of these conditions are present, the lender must remove the retirement account assets from the online loan application, obtain an updated veriﬁcation report that excludes the retirement account, and resubmit the loan to DU.
Note: If the lender would like to use the asset veriﬁcation report to supplement the credit risk assessment in DU, see Rent Payment History in B3-2-03, Risk Factors Evaluated by DU for additional information.

B3-2-03, Risk Factors Evaluated by DU (02/05/2025)
Introduction This topic contains information on the risk factors evaluated by DU, including:
Risk Factors Evaluated by DU Credit History Delinquent Accounts Installment Loans Rent Payment History Revolving Credit Utilization Public Records, Foreclosures, and Collection Accounts Inquiries Borrower’s Equity and LTV Ratio Liquid Reserves Loan Purpose Loan Term Loan Amortization Type Occupancy Type Debt-to-Income Ratio Housing Expense Property Type First-time Homebuyer Cash Flow Assessment for Certain Loan Caseﬁles
Risk Factors Evaluated by DU
DU considers the following characteristics in the credit report to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers who have traditional credit histories: credit history, delinquent accounts, installment accounts, revolving credit utilization, public records, foreclosures, collection accounts, and inquiries.
The non-credit risk factors evaluated by DU include: the borrower’s equity and LTV ratio, liquid reserves, loan purpose, loan term, loan amortization type, occupancy type, debt-to-income ratio, housing expense ratio, property type, and variable income.
DU performs a comprehensive evaluation of these factors, weighing each factor based on the amount of risk it represents and its importance to the recommendation. DU analyzes the results of this evaluation along with the evaluation of the borrower’s credit proﬁle to arrive at the underwriting recommendation for the loan caseﬁle.
More information on these risk factors is provided below. Also see below for information about the risk factors DU considers when evaluating loans where no borrower has a credit score.
Credit History
Published February 5, 2025
281
A borrower’s credit history is an account of how well the borrower has handled credit, both now and in the past. An older, established history—even though the accounts may have zero balances—will have a more positive impact on the borrower’s credit proﬁle than newly established accounts.
A borrower who has no open credit accounts or a relatively new credit history (a few recently opened accounts) is not automatically considered a high credit risk. Successfully managing newly established accounts, including making payments as agreed, signiﬁes lower risk.
Delinquent Accounts
Payment history is a signiﬁcant factor in the evaluation of the borrower’s credit. DU considers the severity of the delinquencies (30, 60, 90, or more days late), the length of time since the delinquencies, and the number and type of accounts that were not paid as agreed.
A payment history that includes bills that are 30 days or more past-due, or a history of paying bills late as evidenced by a number of accounts with late payments, will have a negative impact on the borrower’s credit proﬁle. The amount of time that has elapsed since an account was delinquent is an important factor included in the evaluation of the payment history. For example, a 30-day late payment that is less than three months old indicates a higher risk than a 30-day late payment that occurred several years ago.
Installment Loans
DU evaluates how well a borrower manages debt for all types of installment loans such as mortgage, second lien, auto, unsecured, and student loans. Research has shown that borrowers with no active installment accounts, or installment accounts that have a minimal reduction in balance, represent a higher risk than borrowers who have active installment accounts that have either paid down or paid oﬀ the installment debt.
Rent Payment History
For certain loan caseﬁles, DU can consider a borrower's rent payment history identiﬁed on a 12-month third- party asset veriﬁcation report or a credit report. When DU logic can identify rent payments in the asset veriﬁcation report or credit report, it will use the rent payment history to positively supplement the credit risk assessment.
The following requirements apply when using rent payment history in DU:
At least one borrower must have been renting for at least 12 months with a monthly rent payment of $300 or more and one of the following:
have no mortgage reported on their credit report, have a limited credit history, or have no credit score.
When the rent payment history does not appear on the credit report, for DU to be able to identify rent payments using an asset veriﬁcation report, the lender must
enter the monthly rent paid by the borrower in the online loan application, obtain an asset veriﬁcation report with 12 months of bank statement data through an authorized DU validation service asset veriﬁcation report vendor, and
Published February 5, 2025
282
conﬁrm the borrower is an account holder and that the account provided in the asset veriﬁcation report is the one from which the borrower pays rent.
At the time of loan origination, the originating lender must have access to the full asset veriﬁcation report containing the data covering the period of time provided to DU for assessment.
When an asset veriﬁcation report is used for both rent history and asset documentation, including asset validation through the DU validation service, only the most recent 60 days of account activity must be reviewed in accordance with the requirements in B3-4.2-02, Depository Accounts and B3-2-02, DU Validation Service, and retained in the loan ﬁle. For additional details on record retention, see A2-4.1-01, Establishing Loan Files.
Revolving Credit Utilization
The establishment, use, and amount of revolving credit a borrower has available are important. Trended credit data is used to evaluate the borrower’s ability to manage revolving accounts. A borrower who uses revolving accounts conservatively, meaning low revolving credit utilization or regular payoﬀ of revolving balance, is considered lower risk. A borrower whose revolving credit utilization is high or who has low available revolving credit is considered higher risk.
Public Records, Foreclosures, and Collection Accounts
A credit history that includes any signiﬁcant derogatory credit event is considered high risk. Signiﬁcant derogatory credit events include bankruptcy ﬁlings, foreclosures, deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure, preforeclosure sales, mortgage charge-oﬀs, or accounts that have been turned over to a collection agency.
Note: Collection accounts reported as medical collections are not used in the DU risk assessment.
Inquiries
DU evaluates inquiries on the credit report. Research has shown that a high number of inquiries can indicate a higher degree of risk. However, multiple inquiries made by diﬀerent mortgage lenders or diﬀerent auto loan creditors within the same time frame is not viewed by DU as multiple inquiries (these types of inquiries generally reﬂect borrowers shopping for favorable rates or terms). A borrower who has frequently applied for, or obtained, new or additional credit represents a higher risk.
Borrower’s Equity and LTV Ratio
The amount of equity in the property is a very important component of the risk analysis. Research has shown that a borrower who makes a large down payment or who has considerable equity in their property is less likely to become delinquent on a mortgage loan than a borrower who makes a small down payment or has a small amount of equity in the property. In other words, the more equity a borrower has in the property, the lower the risk associated with the borrower’s mortgage loan.
DU may use a low LTV ratio to oﬀset other risks that it may identify in the loan application.
Published February 5, 2025
283
Liquid Reserves
Liquid reserves are those ﬁnancial assets that are available to a borrower after a loan closes. Reserves are calculated as the total amount of liquid assets remaining after the loan transaction closes divided by the qualifying payment amount.
DU considers higher amounts of liquid reserves as more favorable than lower amounts or no reserves. Research has shown that mortgages to borrowers with higher amounts of liquid reserves tend to have lower delinquency rates. As with a low LTV ratio, DU may consider high amounts of reserves as an oﬀset for other risks that it may identify in the loan application.
Loan Purpose
There is a certain level of risk associated with every transaction, whether it is a purchase or a reﬁnance. Purchase transactions represent less risk than reﬁnance transactions. When evaluating reﬁnance transactions, a limited cash-out reﬁnance transaction represents less risk than a cash-out reﬁnance transaction.
Loan Term
Research has shown that mortgages to borrowers who choose to ﬁnance their mortgages over shorter terms and build up equity in their properties faster generally tend to perform better than mortgages with longer amortization periods.
Loan Amortization Type
Research has shown that there is a diﬀerence in loan performance based on the manner in which the mortgage amortizes. Fixed-rate mortgages will be viewed as representing less risk than adjustable-rate mortgages.
Occupancy Type
Performance statistics on investor loans are notably worse than those of owner-occupied or second home loans. Owner-occupied transactions represent the least risk, followed by second home transactions, and investment property transactions having the highest risk level.
Debt-to-Income Ratio
In DU’s evaluation, generally, the lower the borrower’s debt-to-income ratio (DTI ratio), the lower the associated risk. As the ratio increases, the level of risk also tends to increase; and a high ratio will have the greatest adverse impact on the recommendation when there are also other high-risk factors present.
The composition of the borrower’s debt is also taken into consideration, speciﬁcally those with student loan debt.
Published February 5, 2025
284
Housing Expense
Borrowers whose housing expense makes up a smaller portion of their total expenses are considered lower risk, while those with a housing expense that makes up a higher portion of their total expenses are considered higher risk. Research has shown that borrowers whose total monthly expenses are composed primarily of their housing expense may ﬁnd it more diﬃcult to pay this expense when experiencing an event that would cause ﬁnancial distress, such as the loss of a job.
Property Type
Another important factor that DU considers in the risk analysis is the collateral or property type. DU diﬀerentiates the risk based on the number of units, and in some cases the property type (e.g., manufactured home).
The level of risk associated with each property type is as follows, starting with those property types representing the least amount of risk:
one-unit properties;
condo and co-op properties;
two-, three-, and four-unit properties;
manufactured homes.
First-time Homebuyer
The presence of a ﬁrst-time homebuyer on the loan application is considered a mitigating factor in the DU risk assessment.
Cash Flow Assessment for Certain Loan Caseﬁles
For certain loan caseﬁles, DU can conduct a cash ﬂow assessment when the lender provides a 12-month third- party asset veriﬁcation report for the borrower. DU will assess the borrower's cash ﬂow management history to determine whether it can be used to positively supplement the credit risk assessment.
To be eligible for the cash ﬂow assessment in DU
The lender must obtain an asset veriﬁcation report with 12 months of bank data through an authorized DU validation service asset veriﬁcation report vendor and conﬁrm the borrower is an account holder. At the time of loan origination, the originating lender must have access to the full asset veriﬁcation report containing the data covering the timeframe provided to DU for the cash ﬂow assessment.
When DU conducts a cash ﬂow assessment and provides an Approve/Eligible recommendation, the 12-month asset veriﬁcation report may also be used to satisfy the nontraditional credit history requirements when one is required for any borrower without a credit score as outlined in B3-5.4-03, Documentation and Assessment of a Nontraditional Credit History.
Published February 5, 2025
285
When an asset veriﬁcation report is used for both the cash ﬂow assessment and asset documentation, including asset validation through the DU validation service, only the most recent 30 or 60 days of account activity must be reviewed in accordance with the requirements in B3-4.2-02, Depository Accounts, and B3-2-02, DU Validation Service, and retained in the loan ﬁle. For additional details on record retention, see A2-4.1-01, Establishing Loan Files.
Note: If a 12-month asset veriﬁcation report is not obtained, nontraditional credit references may be required for each borrower without a credit score. See B3-5.4-01, Eligibility Requirements for Loans with Nontraditional Credit.

DU Documentation Requirements Transferring Documentation Flexibilities to Another Lender
Required Documentation for the Permanent Loan File
The following documents must be maintained in the permanent loan ﬁle:
the complete loan application (the full Form 1003),
the ﬁnal DU Underwriting Findings report, and
the ﬁnal Underwriting Analysis report produced by DU.
Lenders are not required to prepare a Uniform Underwriting and Transmittal Summary (Form 1008) for loans underwritten with DU and subsequently delivered to Fannie Mae.
DU Documentation Requirements
DU indicates the minimum veriﬁcation documentation requirements necessary for the lender to process the loan application. While DU may oﬀer a reduced level of documentation, a more comprehensive level of documentation is always acceptable and in some instances should be required by lenders when circumstances in the loan ﬁle warrant it.
DU documentation requirements are based on the speciﬁc risk factors present in each loan ﬁle. The requirements appear in the DU Underwriting Findings report in the section titled Veriﬁcation Messages/Approval Conditions. DU indicates the minimum documentation requirements for income and asset veriﬁcation, credit- related documentation, and level of property ﬁeldwork.
Transferring Documentation Flexibilities to Another Lender
The documentation ﬂexibilities that apply to loan caseﬁles underwritten with DU are transferable to any lender that subsequently delivers the mortgage to, or services it for, Fannie Mae.
The terms of the closed mortgage and the information in the underwriting ﬁle must match the data on which DU based its recommendation. For additional information, see:
B3-2-10, Accuracy of DU Data, DU Tolerances, and Errors in the Credit Report, and

The lender manually underwrites the loan in
accordance with this Selling Guide if the loan product
or transaction otherwise allows for sale of manually
underwritten loans. See B3-1-01, Comprehensive
Risk Assessment and the Eligibility Matrix for
appropriate eligibility requirements and
considerations.
Lender Response to an Approve/Ineligible Recommendation
When a loan caseﬁle receives an Approve/Ineligible recommendation, the lender should:
Review the DU loan data for accuracy and verify that all income, assets, and liabilities were accurately recorded and fully disclosed by the borrower. Determine if there is any information outside of the data submitted to DU that could have aﬀected DU's recommendation. In some cases, updating information may resolve the issue that resulted in the ineligibility.
For example, if the loan is ineligible due to a combination of product features or risk factors that place the loan outside of Fannie Mae's current acquisition preferences and constraints, the borrower may provide documentation of additional income to lower the debt-to-income ratio or provide a larger down payment to lower the LTV ratio.
Update the loan application data (if applicable) and resubmit the loan caseﬁle to DU for an updated recommendation.
If the loan caseﬁle still receives and Approve/Ineligible recommendation, the lender may manually underwrite the loan in accordance with the requirements in the table above.

Lender Response to a Refer with Caution Recommendation
When a loan caseﬁle receives a Refer with Caution recommendation, the lender should:
Review the DU loan data for accuracy and verify that all income, assets, and liabilities were accurately recorded and fully disclosed by the borrower.
Determine if there is any information outside of the data submitted to DU that could have aﬀected DU's recommendation.
Update the loan application data (if applicable) and resubmit the loan caseﬁle to DU for an updated recommendation.
Review the credit report data to determine if the information accurately represents the applicant’s credit history. Erroneous data in the credit report, or contradicting or derogatory information, could have aﬀected DU’s recommendation. (See B3-2-01, General Information on DU, for additional guidance.)
Investigate whether there were any extenuating circumstances that contributed to serious instances of derogatory credit.
If the loan caseﬁle still receives a Refer with Caution recommendation, the lender may manually underwrite the loan in accordance with the requirements in the table above.

Erroneous Credit Report Data Merged Credit Reports and the Impact on DU’s Evaluation Lender Action Regarding Derogatory Credit Reported in Error
Erroneous Credit Report Data
The lender is responsible for ensuring that credit report data used by DU in its underwriting analysis is accurate. Signiﬁcant, material credit errors in a borrower’s credit report may have a negative impact on the underwriting recommendation from DU.
When there is documented evidence of material erroneous credit data, the underwriter should work with the credit repository to correct the data and resubmit the loan caseﬁle to DU for underwriting. If there is not enough time to obtain corrected information, or if there are extenuating circumstances that contributed to the derogatory credit, the lender may manually underwrite the mortgage.
If signiﬁcant material credit errors in the credit report have had a negative impact on the underwriting recommendation from DU resulting in a Refer with Caution recommendation, the lender may consider
Published February 5, 2025

underwriting the loan manually in accordance with this Selling Guide, provided that the loan product or transaction otherwise allows for delivery of manually underwritten loans.
If the loan complies with Fannie Mae’s standard eligibility and underwriting guidelines, it must be delivered as a manually underwritten loan with SFC 343. Such manually underwritten loans are not eligible for DU’s limited waiver of representations and warranties.
Merged Credit Reports and the Impact on DU’s Evaluation
Errors that are the result of the credit merge do not typically aﬀect the credit or risk analysis of the loan caseﬁle.
DU attempts to identify duplicate tradelines, including public record items, that are the result of the merge, and ignores duplicate accounts in the credit analysis.
Public record information is frequently duplicated on the credit report because the credit agencies do not attempt to merge or match items of this severe nature. A public record item may appear in the credit report three times—once from each repository—but the duplication will not aﬀect the risk analysis of the case.
Lender Action Regarding Derogatory Credit Reported in Error
If it is determined that signiﬁcant derogatory credit has been reported in error, the lender must obtain written documentation that supports the error. The following types of written documentation support erroneous information:
a supplement to the credit report
a new mortgage credit report,
documentation from the credit provider that reported the error.

DU Tolerances for Reﬁnance Transaction Loan Amount Changes
For reﬁnance transactions, Fannie Mae allows the following tolerances to the loan amount:
The loan amount may increase $500 or up to 1% of the loan amount, whichever is less.
The loan amount may decrease 5% of the loan amount.
The loan amount tolerances are permitted provided the new LTV/CLTV does not result in
changes to the amount of required mortgage insurance coverage,
diﬀerent loan-level price adjustments, or
changes to loan eligibility.
For example, if a loan caseﬁle is submitted with a loan amount of $100,000 and the appraised value is $120,000 (which equals 83.3% LTV), the actual loan amount can go up to $100,500 (which equals 83.75% LTV) without requiring resubmission.
On the other hand, if the original loan amount was $108,000 (90% LTV), an increase without resubmission is not permitted because it would result in an LTV of 91%. The higher LTV requires diﬀerent mortgage insurance coverage, and may result in the loan not being eligible for delivery.
The loan amount tolerance does not apply to Fannie Mae’s requirements regarding the amount of cash back to the borrower on a limited cash-out reﬁnance transaction. (See B2-1.3-02, Limited Cash-Out Reﬁnance Transactions.)
Other Errors in the Credit Data
In some cases, errors are the result of reporting errors by the credit agency or individual creditors.
If the printed credit report contains derogatory information, and DU does not recognize or consider the derogatory information and does not reﬂect the derogatory information in the DU Underwriting Findings report, the lender must take action when information not considered by DU would result in a recommendation other than that returned by DU.
For example, if a borrower’s credit report indicates that the borrower had a previous foreclosure, but the DU Underwriting Findings report does not reference the foreclosure, a reporting or data transfer error may have occurred, thus preventing DU from considering the foreclosure in its analysis of the loan. The lender must take action to ensure that the information is considered in the risk analysis.
Non-Applicant Debts/Accounts
Published February 5, 2025
297
In a small number of caseﬁles, credit reports may include accounts identiﬁed as possible non-applicant accounts (or with another similar notation). DU will include these tradelines in the credit risk assessment, and will also include the accounts in the DTI ratio when provided on the loan application. See B3-6-05, Monthly Debt Obligations for the requirements.

Overview Potential Red Flag Messages
Overview
The DU Underwriting Findings report summarizes the overall underwriting recommendation and eligibility component of the loan caseﬁle and lists certain steps necessary for the lender to complete the processing of the loan ﬁle.
Speciﬁc messages are provided for each individual loan caseﬁle. These detailed messages are designed to assist lenders in processing and closing loans. However, the level of documentation recommended by DU may not be adequate for every borrower and every situation.
The DU Underwriting Findings report is divided into sections. Each section contains a diﬀerent type of message. Certain messages will be provided based on the DU credit risk assessment. For example, some messages are returned only on Approve recommendations, while other messages are returned only on Refer with Caution recommendations.
Published February 5, 2025
298
Potential Red Flag Messages
DU provides a number of “potential red ﬂag” messages designed to help the lender detect inconsistencies in the loan caseﬁle. Neither the presence nor absence of these messages alters the lender’s responsibility to ensure accurate information in all areas of the loan process or otherwise comply with applicable law, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
Note: The appearance of these messages does not aﬀect the underwriting recommendation from DU. Rather, they are designed to help lenders detect inconsistencies. Furthermore, the absence of any of these messages does not indicate or imply Fannie Mae’s acceptance of the data submitted to DU.
The following lists potential red ﬂag messages:
Excessive resubmissions: A message alerts lenders when an unusually high number of loan resubmissions may be the result of data manipulation.
Frozen credit report: A message alerts lenders when a borrower has frozen their account with one of the credit repositories.
Potential caseﬁle ID reuse: A message alerts lenders when the subject property address, Doc File ID, occupancy, or loan purpose have been modiﬁed. The message serves as a reminder that the DU loan caseﬁle ID is unique to an individual loan and the same caseﬁle ID may not be used to underwrite more than one loan in DU.

Chapter B3-3, Income Assessment
Introduction
This chapter describes the requirements for evaluating income stability, adequacy, and likelihood of continuance — key factors used in qualifying the borrower and assessing his or her capacity to repay the mortgage over the life of the loan.
Published February 5, 2025
299
Section B3-3.1, Employment and Other Sources of Income
B3-3.1-01, General Income Information (05/01/2024)
Introduction This topic contains general information for income, including:
Stable and Predictable Income Variable Income Continuity of Income Determining the Need for Federal Income Tax Returns Veriﬁcation of Income for Non-U.S. Citizen Borrowers Using Nontaxable Income to Adjust the Borrower’s Gross Income Reduced Income Documentation Requirements for High LTV Reﬁnance Loans Income Paid in Virtual Currency
Stable and Predictable Income
Fannie Mae’s underwriting guidelines emphasize the continuity of a borrower’s stable income. The stable and reliable ﬂow of income is a key consideration in mortgage loan underwriting. Individuals who change jobs frequently, but who are nevertheless able to earn consistent and predictable income, are also considered to have a reliable ﬂow of income for qualifying purposes.
To demonstrate the likelihood that a consistent level of income will continue to be received for borrowers with less predictable sources of income, the lender must obtain information about prior earnings. Examples of less predictable income sources include commissions, bonuses, substantial amounts of overtime pay, or employment that is subject to time limits, such as contract employees or tradesmen.
Variable Income
All income that is calculated by an averaging method must be reviewed to assess the borrower’s history of receipt, the frequency of payment, and the trending of the amount of income being received. Examples of income of this type include income from hourly workers with ﬂuctuating hours, or income that includes commissions, bonuses, or overtime.
History of Receipt: Two or more years of receipt of a particular type of variable income is recommended; however, variable income that has been received for 12 to 24 months may be considered as acceptable income, as long as the borrower’s loan application demonstrates that there are positive factors that reasonably oﬀset the shorter income history.
Published February 5, 2025
300
For loans with variable income validated by the DU validation service, the required history of receipt may diﬀer from the requirements described above. DU will determine the history required to validate an income type.
Frequency of Payment: The lender must determine the frequency of the payment (weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually) to arrive at an accurate calculation of the monthly income to be used in the trending analysis (see below). Examples:
If a borrower is paid an annual bonus on March 31st of each year, the amount of the March bonus should be divided by 12 to obtain an accurate calculation of the current monthly bonus amount. Note that
dividing the bonus received on March 31st by three months produces a much higher, inaccurate monthly average.
If a borrower is paid overtime on a biweekly basis, the most recent paystub must be analyzed to determine that both the current overtime earnings for the period and the year-to-date overtime earnings are consistent and, if not, why. There are legitimate reasons why these amounts may be inconsistent yet still eligible for use as qualifying income. For example, borrowers may have overtime income that is cyclical (such as transportation employees who operate snow plows in winter, package delivery service workers who work longer hours through the holidays). The lender must investigate the diﬀerence between current period overtime and year-to-date earnings and document the analysis before using the income amount in the trending analysis.
Income Trending: After the monthly year-to-date income amount is calculated, it must be compared to prior years’ earnings using the borrower’s W-2’s or signed federal income tax returns (or a standard Veriﬁcation of Employment completed by the employer or third-party employment veriﬁcation vendor).
If the trend in the amount of income is stable or increasing, the income amount should be averaged.
If the trend was declining, but has since stabilized and there is no reason to believe that the borrower will not continue to be employed at the current level, the current, lower amount of variable income must be used.
If the trend is declining, the income may not be stable. Additional analysis must be conducted to determine if any variable income should be used, but in no instance may it be averaged over the period when the declination occurred.
Continuity of Income
A key driver of successful homeownership is conﬁdence that all income used in qualifying the borrower will continue to be received by the borrower for the foreseeable future. Unless the lender has knowledge to the contrary, if the income does not have a deﬁned expiration date and the applicable history of receipt of the income is documented (per the speciﬁc income type), the lender may conclude that the income is stable, predictable, and likely to continue. The lender is not expected to request additional documentation from the borrower.
If the income source does have a deﬁned expiration date or is dependent on the depletion of an asset account or other limited beneﬁt, the lender must document the likelihood of continued receipt of the income for at least three years.
If the lender is notiﬁed that the borrower is transitioning to a lower pay structure, for example due to pending
Published February 5, 2025
301
retirement or a new job, the lender must use the lower amount to qualify the borrower.
The following table contains examples of income types with and without deﬁned expiration dates. This information is provided to assist lenders in determining whether additional income documentation may be necessary to support a three-year continuance. Lenders are responsible for making the ﬁnal determination of whether the borrower’s speciﬁc income source has a deﬁned expiration date. See B3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income for additional information related to the use and documentation of speciﬁc income sources.

Note that continuity of income for trust income must be based on the type of income received through the trust. For example, if the income from the trust is derived from rental income, then three-year continuance is not required. However, if the income is a ﬁxed payment derived from a depleting asset, then three-year continuance must be determined.
Income sources that are not listed above will require lender judgment to determine if documentation of continuance must be obtained.
Determining the Need for Federal Income Tax Returns
Published February 5, 2025
302
The lender must obtain copies of the borrower’s signed federal income tax returns ﬁled with the IRS for the past one or two years (depending on the income type) for the following sources of income or employment. Refer to the applicable topics in Chapter B3-3, Income Assessment for additional information about speciﬁc tax return requirements.
Tax returns are required if the borrower
is employed by family members (two years’ returns);
is employed by interested parties to the property sale or purchase (two years’ returns);
receives rental income from an investment property;
receives income from temporary or periodic employment (or unemployment) or employment that is subject to time limits, such as a contract employee or a tradesman;
receives income from capital gains, royalties, or other miscellaneous non-employment earnings reported on IRS Form 1099;
receives income that cannot otherwise be veriﬁed by an independent and knowledgeable source (two years’ returns);
uses foreign income to qualify;
uses interest and dividend income to qualify;
uses tip income reported on IRS Form 4137 that was not reported by the employer on the W-2 to qualify; or
receives income from sole proprietorships, limited liability companies, partnerships, or corporations, or any other type of business structure in which the borrower has a 25% or greater ownership interest. Borrowers with a 25% or greater ownership interest are considered self-employed. The lender must document and underwrite the loan application using the requirements for self-employed borrowers, as described in Section B3–3.2, Self-Employment Income. Note that for DU loan caseﬁles, only the most recent year of tax returns may be required.
If a borrower’s income is validated by the DU validation service, lenders are not required to determine if the borrower is employed by a family member or interested party to the property sale or purchase. See B3-2-02, DU Validation Service.
See B3-3.1-06, Requirements and Uses of IRS IVES Request for Transcript of Tax Return Form 4506-C, for information about obtaining tax return transcripts.

For information on U.S. citizens earning foreign income, refer to B3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income.
Using Nontaxable Income to Adjust the Borrower’s Gross Income
The lender should give special consideration to regular sources of income that may be nontaxable, such as child support payments, Social Security beneﬁts, workers’ compensation beneﬁts, certain types of public assistance payments, and food stamps.
The lender must verify that the particular source of income is nontaxable, unless the source of income meets one of the exceptions below. Documentation that can be used for this veriﬁcation includes award letters, policy agreements, account statements, tax returns or any other documents that address the nontaxable status of the income.
If the income is veriﬁed to be nontaxable, and the income and its tax-exempt status are likely to continue, the lender should develop an “adjusted gross income” for the borrower by adding an amount equivalent to 25% of the nontaxable income to the borrower’s income.
If the actual amount of federal and state taxes that would generally be paid by a wage earner in a similar tax bracket is more than 25% of the borrower’s nontaxable income, the lender may use that amount to develop the adjusted gross income, which should be used in calculating the borrower’s qualifying ratio.
Exceptions:
The lender is not required to provide documentation to support that the income is nontaxable for the following:
Child support income: The full amount of documented qualifying child support is nontaxable. Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Homeownership Program payments: The full amount of income from these payments is nontaxable. Social Security income: 15% of the income is nontaxable.
Example for Social Security income
Published February 5, 2025
304
Beneﬁt amount: $1,500
Nontaxable amount: $1,500 x 15% = $225
Gross-up amount: $225 x 25% = $56 (rounded to the nearest dollar)
Qualifying income: $1,556 (does not require additional documentation)
Note: If the lender opts to gross-up more than 15% of Social Security income, documentation to support that the additional income is nontaxable must be included in the loan ﬁle.
Reduced Income Documentation Requirements for High LTV Reﬁnance Loans
For certain high LTV reﬁnance loans, lenders are not required to follow the income documentation requirements described in this Chapter. Refer to Chapter B5-7: High Loan-to-Value Reﬁnance Option for speciﬁc requirements.
Income Paid in Virtual Currency
Any income paid to or earned by the borrower in the form of virtual currency, such as cryptocurrencies, is not eligible to be used to qualify for the loan. For other income types see B3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income.

Introduction This topic contains information on the standards for documentation of employment income, including:
General Documentation Requirements Employment Documentation Provided by the Borrower Employment Documentation Provided by the Borrower’s Employer Employment Documentation Provided by a Third-Party Employment Veriﬁcation Vendor
General Documentation Requirements
The lender must verify employment income for all borrowers whose income is used to qualify for the loan. This veriﬁcation can be provided by the borrower, by the borrower’s employer, or by a third-party employment veriﬁcation vendor.
When employment is validated through the DU validation service using an asset veriﬁcation report, the lender is not required to obtain the employment documentation described below. DU will provide messaging indicating the documentation required. Lenders must comply with all requirements pertaining to the DU validation service. See B3-2-02, DU Validation Service.
Employment Documentation Provided by the Borrower
The following table provides requirements for documentation provided by the borrower.
✓
Requirements — Paystubs and W–2s
The paystub must be dated no earlier than 30 days prior to the initial loan application date
and it must include all year-to-date earnings. Additionally, the paystub must include suﬃcient
information to appropriately calculate income; otherwise, additional documentation must be
obtained.
Paystubs must comply with B1-1-03, Allowable Age of Credit Documents and Federal Income
Tax Returns.
Published February 5, 2025
306
✓
Requirements — Paystubs and W–2s
IRS W-2 forms must cover the most recent one- or two-year period, based on the
documentation requirements for the particular income type. The W-2 forms must clearly
identify the borrower as the employee.
”Most recent” W-2 is deﬁned as the W-2 for the calendar year prior to the current calendar
year. Alternative documentation, such as an IRS Wage and Income (W-2) Transcript, a written
Request for Veriﬁcation of Employment (Form 1005) (see below) or the ﬁnal year-to-date
paystub, may be used as long as adequate information is provided.
Documents must be computer-generated or typed by the borrower’s employer(s), although
paystubs that the borrower downloads from the Internet are also acceptable. Documents must
clearly identify the employer’s name and source of information.
The documents must clearly identify the borrower as the employee.
The information must be complete and legible.
The original source of the information must be a third party, such as the borrower's human
resources department, personnel oﬃce, payroll department, company's payroll vendor, or
supervisor.
✔
Requirements — Tax Returns
When required, personal federal income tax returns must be copies of the original returns that
were ﬁled with the IRS. All supporting schedules must be included.
Alternatively, the lender may obtain applicable transcripts of federal income tax returns. See
B3-3.1-06, Requirements and Uses of IRS IVES Request for Transcript of Tax Return Form
4506-C.
“Most recent” tax return is deﬁned as the last return scheduled to have been ﬁled with the
IRS. See B1-1-03, Allowable Age of Credit Documents and Federal Income Tax Returns.
The information must be complete and legible.
Each tax return must be signed by the borrower unless the lender has obtained one of the
following signature alternatives:
documentation conﬁrming that the tax returns were ﬁled electronically,
a completed IRS Form 4506–C (signed by the borrower) for the year in question, or
IRS transcripts that validate the tax return.
Published February 5, 2025
307
Employment Documentation Provided by the Borrower’s Employer
The lender may use the Request for Veriﬁcation of Employment (Form 1005) to document income for a salaried or commissioned borrower. The date of the completed form must comply with B1-1-03, Allowable Age of Credit Documents and Federal Income Tax Returns.
The information on the Form 1005 must be legible. The following ﬁelds on the form are optional:
Field #
Title of Optional Field

24
Reason for leaving (Part III — Veriﬁcation of Previous Employment)
The remaining ﬁelds on the form must be completed as applicable to the borrower. For example, overtime may not be completed if the borrower is in a position that does not pay overtime.
When the borrower authorizes the lender to obtain veriﬁcations of employment and income directly from the employer, the lender must have the borrower sign Form 1005.
Alternatively, the lender may have the applicant sign a signature authorization form, which gives the lender blanket authorization to request the information it needs to evaluate the applicant’s creditworthiness (see B1-1-02, Blanket Authorization Form).
Employment Documentation Provided by a Third-Party Employment Veriﬁcation Vendor

Veriﬁcation of Base Pay, Bonus, and Overtime Income
A minimum history of two years of employment income is recommended. However, income
that has been received for a shorter period of time may be considered as acceptable income,
as long as the borrower’s employment proﬁle demonstrates that there are positive factors to
reasonably oﬀset the shorter income history.
Borrowers relying on overtime or bonus income for qualifying purposes must have a history of
no less than 12 months to be considered stable.
Base Pay (Salary and Hourly):
Obtain the following documents:
a completed Request for Veriﬁcation of Employment (Form 1005), or
the borrower’s recent paystub and IRS W-2 forms covering the most recent two-year period.
Bonus or Overtime:
Obtain the following documents:
a completed Form 1005, or
the borrower’s recent paystub and IRS W-2 forms covering the most recent two-year period.
See B3-3.1-01, General Income Information, for additional information on calculating variable
income (applies to hourly paid employees with ﬂuctuating hours and bonus and overtime).
If the borrower has recently changed positions with their employer, determine the eﬀect of the
change on the borrower’s eligibility and opportunity to receive bonus or overtime pay in the
future.
If a borrower who has historically been employed on a part-time basis indicates that they
are now working full-time, obtain written conﬁrmation from the borrower’s employer.
A verbal VOE is required from each employer. See B3-3.1-07, Verbal Veriﬁcation of
Employment, for speciﬁc requirements.
See B3-3.1-02, Standards for Employment Documentation, for additional information about
verifying employment income.
Base Income Calculation Guidelines
After the applicable income documentation has been obtained, the lender must calculate the borrower’s eligible qualifying base income. The following table provides guidance for standard employment documentation:
Published February 5, 2025

How Often Paid
How to Determine Monthly Income
Annually
Annual gross pay / 12 months
Monthly
Use monthly gross payment amount
Twice Monthly
Twice monthly gross pay x 2 pay periods
Biweekly
(Biweekly gross pay x 26 pay periods) / 12 months
Weekly
(Weekly gross pay x 52 pay periods) / 12 months
Hourly
(Hourly gross pay x average # of hours worked per
week x 52 weeks) / 12 months
All of the above calculations must be compared with the documented year-to-date base earnings (and past
year earnings, if applicable) to determine if the income amount appears to be consistent. See B3-3.1-01,
General Income Information, for additional information about variable income (bonus and overtime).
Military Income
Military personnel may be entitled to diﬀerent types of pay in addition to their base pay. Flight or hazard pay, rations, clothing allowance, quarters’ allowance, and proﬁciency pay are acceptable sources of stable income, as long as the lender can establish that the particular source of income will continue to be received in the future. To verify military base pay and entitlements, the lender must obtain the borrower's most recent Leave and Earnings Statement (LES).
Income paid to military reservists while they are satisfying their reserve obligations also is acceptable if it satisﬁes the same stability and continuity tests applied to secondary employment.

B3-3.1-06, Requirements and Uses of IRS IVES Request for Transcript
of Tax Return Form 4506-C (12/16/2020)
Introduction The IRS Form 4506-C is a form that can be utilized by authorized IRS Income Veriﬁcation Express Service (IVES) participants to order tax transcripts electronically with the consent of the taxpayer. This topic contains information on the use of (IRS Form 4506-C), including:
Use of IRS Form 4506-C to Validate Borrower Income Documentation Use of IRS Forms to Obtain Federal Income Tax Information Completing and Submitting the IRS Authorization Form Retaining the Tax Documents
Use of IRS Form 4506-C to Validate Borrower Income Documentation
Fannie Mae requires lenders to have each borrower whose income (regardless of income source) is used to qualify for the loan to complete and sign a separate IRS Form 4506-C at or before closing. An alternative form or process is also acceptable if it authorizes the release of comparable tax information from the IRS. As noted below, it may be necessary to have the borrower complete and sign multiple IRS Form 4506-Cs depending on the transcripts required to validate the income.
Note: Borrowers with income from Puerto Rico must use Modelo SC 2907 (Solicitud De Copia De Planilla, Relevo De Herencia Y De Donacion) rather than IRS Form 4506-C. Applicable forms or processes for eligible borrowers ﬁling tax returns in other U.S. territories must be adhered to and obtained when required.
In addition, the lender must document the requirement to obtain tax transcripts by submitting the IRS Form 4506–C to the IRS (directly or through an authorized designee) in their written quality control (QC) plan. See D1-3-02, Lender Post-Closing Quality Control Review of Approval Conditions, Underwriting Decisions, and Documentation for details concerning QC requirements.
If the lender submits the IRS Form 4506–C to the IRS prior to closing, the transcript(s) must be used to validate the income documentation provided by the borrower and used in the underwriting process. In this case, because the lender has already received the tax transcript(s), an additional signed IRS Form 4506-C is not required to be signed by the borrower.
When all of a borrower’s income is validated by the DU validation service, the lender is not required to obtain a signed IRS Form 4506–C for that borrower.
Use of IRS Forms to Obtain Federal Income Tax Information
When federal income tax information is used to document income for qualifying purposes, the lender may obtain transcripts of the applicable federal income tax documents. For example, the lender may obtain Tax Return Transcripts for Form 1040 or Wage and Income Transcripts for W2s, 1098s, and 1099s. However, in
Published February 5, 2025
315
certain instances, copies of the actual returns, schedules, or forms are needed because the tax return transcripts will not provide the detail required to qualify the borrower. For example, the lender must obtain copies of Schedules B through F, Schedule K-1, or business returns. These schedules or forms are not required if:
the income reﬂected on the applicable schedule transcripts is positive, and
the income supported by that schedule or form is not being used for qualifying.
If a borrower’s self-employment income from a sole proprietorship (as reported on IRS Form 1040, Schedule C or C-EZ) is validated by the DU validation service, lenders are not required to obtain the tax returns. Documentation in accordance with the DU message is acceptable. The DU message may allow a tax transcript rather than the tax returns. See B3-2-02, DU Validation Service, for additional information.
Completing and Submitting the IRS Authorization Form
IRS Form 4506-C can be used to obtain transcripts for up to four years or tax periods but only one tax form number can be requested per each IRS Form 4506-C. For example, it is necessary to complete two IRS Form 4506-Cs for a self-employed borrower whose income documentation includes both two years of personal tax returns and two years of business tax returns. One IRS Form 4506-C will be required to obtain a transcript of the personal 1040 returns and another will be required for the business returns (Form 1065, Form 1120, Form 1120A, etc.).
Lenders must
ﬁll in as the recipient of the tax documents — either its name or the name of the servicer, if servicing will be transferred within 120 days of the taxpayer signing the form;
indicate that the request is for documentation concerning the year or years for which the borrower’s income was or will be used in underwriting the loan; and
date the form(s) with the date on which the borrower signs the form (or ascertain that the borrower dates the form when they sign it).
IRS Form 4506-C is valid for 120 days after completion (including signature) by the borrower.
Note: The borrower should not be required to sign an IRS authorization form before all items on the form, including the transcript being requested, the years/tax periods, and the date, have been completed.
Retaining the Tax Documents
All tax documents, including either the IRS Form 4506-C or the tax transcript(s) received from the IRS, and any subsequent explanation or documentation of discrepancies must be retained in the loan ﬁle for QC review.

B3-3.1-07, Verbal Veriﬁcation of Employment (03/06/2024)
Introduction This topic contains information on verbal veriﬁcation of employment requirements for all borrowers.
Verbal Veriﬁcation of Employment
Verbal Veriﬁcation of Employment
Lenders must obtain a verbal veriﬁcation of employment (verbal VOE) for each borrower using employment or self-employment income to qualify. The verbal VOE must be obtained within 10 business days prior to the note date for employment income, and within 120 calendar days prior to the note date for self-employment income. The verbal VOE requirement is intended to help lenders mitigate risk by conﬁrming, as late in the process as possible, that the borrower remains employed as originally disclosed on the loan application. A change in the borrower’s employment status could have a signiﬁcant impact on that borrower’s capacity to repay the mortgage loan and must be fully reevaluated.
Alternatively, lenders may obtain the verbal VOE after closing, up to the time of loan delivery. If the verbal VOE (or allowable alternative) cannot be obtained prior to delivery, the loan is ineligible for sale to Fannie Mae.
Note: If the employer conﬁrms the borrower is currently on temporary leave, the lender must consider the borrower “employed.” See B3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income, for details on temporary leave.
The following table describes the requirements for a verbal VOE and allowable alternatives.

Requirements
Verbal Veriﬁcation of Employment:
The lender must independently obtain a phone number and, if possible, an address for the borrower's
employer. This can be accomplished by using a telephone book, the Internet, directory assistance, or by
contacting the applicable licensing bureau.
The lender must contact the employer verbally and conﬁrm the borrower's current employment status
within 10 business days prior to the note date.
Note: If the employer conﬁrms the borrower is currently on temporary leave, the lender must consider the
borrower “employed.” See B3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income, for details on temporary leave.
The conversation must be documented. It should include the following:
⚬ name and title of the person who conﬁrmed the employment for the lender,
⚬ name and title of the person who completed the veriﬁcation for the employer,
⚬ date of the call, and
⚬ the source of the phone number.
Alternative Methods to Verify Employment:
The lender can obtain a written veriﬁcation conﬁrming the borrower’s current employment status within
10 business days prior to the note date. The written documentation must include the name and title of the
person who completed the veriﬁcation for the employer.
The lender can obtain an email exchange with the borrower's employer from the employer's work email
address within 10 business days prior to the note date.
⚬ The lender must conduct additional due diligence to conﬁrm that the email address for the employer
is accurate. Examples of due diligence include, but are not limited to, searches of domain name on
employer website (review for match to employer email address), employer directory on the internet, or
other professional networking or business proﬁle websites.
⚬ The email exchange must include borrower's name and employer's name; name, title, and work email
address of the individual contacted at the employer; date of contact; and borrower's current employment
status.
Within 15 business days prior to the note date, the borrower can provide either
⚬ the most recent available paystub as of that date that, meets the requirements in B3-3.1-02,
Standards for Employment Documentation; reﬂects information for the most recent expected pay period
based on the date it is provided and the borrower's pay cadence; and does not include any information
indicating the borrower may not be actively employed.​
Bank statements dated no earlier than 15 business days prior to the note date that
⚬ meet the requirements in B3-4.2-01, Veriﬁcation of Deposits and Assets,
⚬ reﬂects information for the most recent expected pay period based on the date of the statement and
the borrower's pay cadence, and
⚬ does not include any information indicating the borrower may not be actively employed.
If the borrower is a union member who works in an occupation that results in a series of short-term job
assignments (such as a skilled construction worker, longshoreman, or stagehand), and the union facilitates
the borrower’s placement in each assignment, the lender may obtain the verbal VOE from the union.
If the employer uses a third-party employment veriﬁcation vendor, the lender must obtain written
veriﬁcation from the vendor of the borrower’s current employment status within the same time frame as
the verbal VOE requirements.
Note: Because third-party vendor databases are typically updated monthly, the veriﬁcation must evidence
that the information in the vendor's database was no more than 35 days old as of the note date.
When employment is validated by DU, DU includes in its assessment the age of the information in the
vendor’s database. The DU message will include a date by which the loan must close. This may diﬀer from
the age of data and 10 business day requirements above. Compliance with the DU message satisﬁes the
requirement for completing the veriﬁcation of employment. See B3-2-02, DU Validation Service for
additional information.
When employment is initially validated by the DU validation service using an asset veriﬁcation report, but
the loan will not close by the "Close by Date" stated in the validation message, an alternative method of
reverifying employment is permitted using a supplemental asset report. See B3-2-02, DU Validation
Service for additional information.

In conjunction with the policies in this topic, lenders must also comply with, as applicable, but not limited to, the policies in the following:
B2-2-03, Multiple Financed Properties for the Same Borrower;
B3-3.1-01, General Income Information (Continuity of Income);
B3-3.5-02, Income from Rental Property in DU;
B3-4.1-01, Minimum Reserve Requirements; and
B3-6-06, Qualifying Impact of Other Real Estate Owned.
Eligible Properties
Rental income is an acceptable source of stable income if it can be established that the income is likely to continue. If the rental income is derived from the subject property, the property must be one of the following:
a two- to four-unit principal residence property in which the borrower occupies one of the units, or
a one- to four-unit investment property.
If the income is derived from a property that is not the subject property, there are no restrictions on the property type. For example, rental income from a commercial property owned by the borrower is acceptable if the income otherwise meets all other requirements (it can be documented in accordance with the requirements below).
Ineligible Properties
Generally, rental income from the borrower’s principal residence (a one-unit principal residence or the unit the borrower occupies in a two- to four-unit property) or a second home cannot be used to qualify the borrower. However, Fannie Mae does allow certain exceptions to this policy for boarder income and properties with accessory units. See B3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income, for boarder income requirements, and B5-6-02, HomeReady Mortgage Underwriting Methods and Requirements, for accessory unit income requirements.
General Requirements for Documenting Rental Income (Subject and Non- Subject Property)
Published February 5, 2025
320
If a borrower has a history of renting the subject or another property, generally the rental income will be reported on IRS Form 1040, Schedule E of the borrower’s personal tax returns or on Rental Real Estate Income and Expenses of a Partnership or an S Corporation form (IRS Form 8825) of a business tax return. If the borrower does not have a history of renting the property or if, in certain cases, the tax returns do not accurately reﬂect the ongoing income and expenses of the property, the lender may be justiﬁed in using a fully executed current lease agreement. Examples of scenarios that justify the use of a lease agreement are
purchase transactions where there is an existing lease on the property that will transfer to the borrower;
reﬁnance transactions where the borrower purchased the rental property during or subsequent to the last tax return ﬁling;
reﬁnance transactions for a property that experienced signiﬁcant rental interruptions causing income to not be reported on the most recent tax return (for example, major renovation to a property occurred in the prior year that aﬀected rental income); and
transactions where rental income is being used to qualify for any property placed in service in the current calendar year, for example, when converting a principal residence to an investment property.
When the subject property will generate rental income and it is used for qualifying purposes, one of the following Fannie Mae forms must be used to support the income-earning potential of the property:
For one-unit properties: Single-Family Comparable Rent Schedule (Form 1007) (provided in conjunction with the applicable appraisal report), or
For two- to four-unit properties: Small Residential Income Property Appraisal Report (Form 1025).
Note: The rental payment on the lease must be reﬂected in U.S. dollars (cannot be in virtual currency).
Documenting Rental Income from Subject Property
The lender must obtain documentation that is used to calculate the monthly rental income for qualifying purposes. The documentation may vary depending on whether the borrower has a history of renting the property, and whether the prior year tax return includes the income.

If the borrower is not using any rental income from the subject property to qualify, the gross monthly rent must still be documented for lender reporting purposes. See Reporting of Gross Monthly Rent below for details.
Documenting Rental Income from Property Other Than the Subject Property
When the borrower owns property – other than the subject property – that is rented, the lender must document the monthly gross (and net) rental income with the borrower’s most recent signed federal income tax return that includes Schedule 1 and Schedule E. Copies of the current lease agreement(s) may be substituted if the borrower can document a qualifying exception. See Reconciling Partial or No Rental History on Tax Returns
Published February 5, 2025

below and Calculating Monthly Qualifying Rental Income (or Loss).
Reconciling Partial or No Rental History on Tax Returns
In order for the lender to determine qualifying rental income, the lender must determine whether or not the rental property was in service for the entire tax year or only a portion of the year. In some situations, the lender’s analysis may determine that using alternative rental income calculations or using lease agreements to calculate income are more appropriate methods for calculating the qualifying income from rental properties. This policy may be applied to reﬁnances of a subject rental property or to other rental properties owned by the borrower.
If the borrower is able to document (per the table below) that the rental property was not in service the previous tax year, or was in service for only a portion of the previous tax year, the lender may determine qualifying rental income by using
Schedule E income and expenses, and annualizing the income (or loss) calculation, or
fully executed lease agreement(s) to determine the gross rental income to be used in the net rental income (or loss) calculation.

used.
The lender must establish a history of property management experience by obtaining one of the following:
The borrower’s most recent signed federal income tax return, including Schedules 1 and E. Schedule E should reﬂect rental income received for any property and Fair Rental Days of 365;
If the property has been owned for at least one year, but there are less than 365 Fair Rental Days on Schedule E, a current signed lease agreement may be used to supplement the federal income tax return; or
A current signed lease may be used to supplement a federal income tax return if the property was out of service for any time period in the prior year. Schedule E must support this by reﬂecting a reduced number of days in use and related repair costs. Form 1007 or Form 1025 must support the income reﬂected on the lease.
Note: The requirements in Calculating Monthly Qualifying Rental Income (or Loss) do not apply to HomeReady loans with rental income from an accessory unit.
Method for Calculating the Income
The method for calculating rental income (or loss) for qualifying purposes is dependent upon the documentation that is being used.
Federal Income Tax Returns, Schedule E. When Schedule E is used to calculate qualifying rental income, the lender must add back any listed depreciation, interest, homeowners’ association dues, taxes, or insurance expenses to the borrower’s cash ﬂow. Non-recurring property expenses may be added back, if documented accordingly.
If the property was in service
for the entire tax year, the rental income must be averaged over 12 months; or
for less than the full year, the rental income must be averaged over the number of months that the borrower used the property as a rental unit.
See Treatment of the Income (or Loss) below for further instructions.
Lease Agreements, Form 1007, or Form 1025
When current lease agreements or market rents reported on Form 1007 or Form 1025 are used, the lender must calculate the rental income by multiplying the gross monthly rent(s) by 75%. (This is referred to as "Monthly Market Rent" on the Form 1007.) The remaining 25% of the gross rent will be absorbed by vacancy losses and ongoing maintenance expenses.
Published February 5, 2025
325
When using a lease agreement, the lease agreement amount must be supported by
Form 1007 or Form 1025, as applicable, or evidence the terms of the lease have gone into eﬀect. Evidence may include:
two months consecutive bank statements or electronic transfers of rental payments for existing lease agreements, or copies of the security deposit and ﬁrst month's rent check with proof of deposit for newly executed agreements.
See Treatment of the Income (or Loss) below for further instructions.
Treatment of the Income (or Loss)
The treatment and amount of monthly qualifying rental income (described above in Calculating Monthly Qualifying Rental Income (or Loss)) used in the calculation of the borrower's total debt-to-income ratio — varies depending on whether the borrower occupies the rental property as their principal residence.
If the rental income relates to the borrower’s principal residence:
The monthly qualifying rental income (as deﬁned above) must be added to the borrower’s total monthly income. (The income is not netted against the PITIA of the property.)
The full amount of the mortgage payment (PITIA) must be included in the borrower’s total monthly obligations when calculating the debt-to-income ratio.
If the rental income (or loss) relates to a property other than the borrower's principal residence:
If the monthly qualifying rental income minus the full PITIA is positive, it must be added to the borrower’s total monthly income (subject to the limits in Calculating Monthly Qualifying Rental Income (or Loss)).
If the monthly qualifying rental income minus PITIA is negative, the monthly net rental loss must be added to the borrower’s total monthly obligations.
The full PITIA for the rental property is factored into the amount of the net rental income (or loss); therefore, it should not be counted as a monthly obligation.
The full monthly payment for the borrower's principal residence (full PITIA or monthly rent) must be counted as a monthly obligation.
Note: When a borrower owns multiple rental properties, the rental income for all non-subject properties is ﬁrst calculated for each property, then aggregated. The aggregate total of the income (or loss) is then added to the borrower's total monthly income or included in their monthly obligations, as applicable.
Oﬀsetting Monthly Obligations for Rental Property Reported through a Partnership or an S Corporation
If the borrower is personally obligated on the mortgage debt (as evidenced by inclusion of the related mortgage(s) on the credit report) and gross rents and related expenses are reported through a partnership or S

corporation, the business tax returns may be used to oﬀset the property’s PITIA. The steps described below should be followed:
1. Obtain the borrower’s business tax returns, including IRS Form 8825 for the most recent year.
2. Evaluate each property listed on Form 8825, as shown below:
From total gross rents, subtract total expenses. Then add back insurance, mortgage interest, taxes, homeowners’ association dues (if applicable), depreciation, and non-recurring property expenses (if documented accordingly).
Divide by the number of months the property was in service.
Subtract the entire PITIA (proposed for subject property or actual for real estate owned) to determine the monthly property cash ﬂow.
3. If the resulting net cash ﬂow is positive, the lender may exclude the property PITIA from the borrower’s monthly obligations when calculating the debt-to-income ratio.
4. If the resulting net cash ﬂow is negative (that is, the rental income derived from the investment property is not suﬃcient to fully oﬀset the property PITIA), the calculated negative amount must be included in the borrower’s monthly obligations when calculating the debt-to-income ratio.
In order to include a positive net rental income received through a partnership or an S corporation in the borrower’s monthly qualifying income, the lender must evaluate it according to Fannie Mae’s guidelines for income received from a partnership or an S corporation. See B3-3.4-01, Analyzing Partnership Returns for a Partnership or LLC and B3-3.4-02, Analyzing Returns for an S Corporation.
Rental Income Calculation Worksheets
Fannie Mae publishes four worksheets that lenders may use to calculate rental income. Use of these worksheets is optional. The worksheets are:
Rental Income Worksheet – Principal Residence, 2– to 4–unit Property (Form 1037),
Rental Income Worksheet – Individual Rental Income from Investment Property(s) (up to 4 properties) (Form 1038),
Rental Income Worksheet – Individual Rental Income from Investment Property(s) (up to 10 properties) (Form 1038A), and
Rental Income Worksheet – Business Rental Income from Investment Property(s) (Form 1039).
Reporting of Gross Monthly Rent
Eligible rents on the subject property (gross monthly rent) must be reported to Fannie Mae in the loan delivery data for all two- to four-unit principal residence properties and investment properties, regardless of whether the borrower is using rental income to qualify for the loan. If the borrower is using rental income from the subject property to qualify for the loan, all of the applicable requirements above must be followed to document and
Published February 5, 2025

calculate the income.
If the borrower is not using any rental income from the subject property to qualify, gross monthly rent must be documented only for lender reporting purposes. The borrower can provide one of the sources listed above, or may provide one of the following sources (listed in order of preference):
the appraisal report for a one-unit investment property or two- to four-unit property, or Single-Family Comparable Rent Schedule (Form 1007), provided neither the applicable appraisal nor Form 1007 is dated 12 months or more prior to the date of the note;
if the property is not currently rented, the lender may use the opinion of market rents provided by the appraiser; or
if an appraisal or Form 1007 is not required for the transaction, the lender may rely upon either a signed lease from the borrower or may obtain a statement from the borrower of the gross monthly rent being charged (or to be charged) for the property. The monthly rental amounts must be stated separately for each unit in a two- to four-unit property. The disclosure from the borrower must be in the form of one of the following:
a written statement from the borrower, or
an addition to the Form 1003.
The lender must retain the documentation in the loan ﬁle that was relied upon to determine the amount of eligible rent reported.

Documentation Requirements for Current Receipt of Income
The documentation required for each income source is described below. The documentation must support the history of receipt, if applicable, and the amount, frequency, and duration of the income. In addition, evidence of current receipt of the income must be obtained in compliance with the Allowable Age of Credit Documents policy, unless speciﬁcally excluded below. See B1-1-03, Allowable Age of Credit Documents and Federal Income Tax Returns, for additional information.
Current receipt may be documented by various means, depending on the income type. Examples include but are not limited to
current paystubs,

bank statements conﬁrming direct deposit,
canceled checks from the payer’s account to the borrower,
court records, or
copies of the borrower’s bank statements showing the regular deposit of these funds.
Note: Any income received by the borrower in the form of virtual currency, such as cryptocurrencies, is not eligible to be used to qualify for the loan. For income types that require suﬃcient remaining assets to establish continuance, those assets cannot be in the form of virtual currency.
Alimony, Child Support, or Separate Maintenance
The following table provides veriﬁcation requirements for alimony, child support, or separate maintenance.
✓
Veriﬁcation of Income From Alimony, Child Support, or Separate Maintenance
Document that alimony, child support, or separate maintenance will continue to be paid for at
least three years after the date of the mortgage application, as veriﬁed by one of the
following:
A copy of a divorce decree or separation agreement (if the divorce is not ﬁnal) that indicates
the monthly payment and states the amount of the award and the period of time over which it
will be received.
Note: If a borrower who is separated does not have a separation agreement that speciﬁes
alimony or child support payments, the lender should not consider any proposed or voluntary
payments as income.
Any other type of written legal agreement or court decree describing the payment terms.
Documentation that veriﬁes any applicable state law that mandates alimony, child support,
or separate maintenance payments, which must specify the conditions under which the
payments must be made.
Check for limitations on the continuance of the payments, such as the age of the children for
whom the support is being paid or the duration over which alimony is required to be paid.
Document no less than six months of the borrower’s most recent regular receipt of the full
payment.
Published February 5, 2025
330
✓
Veriﬁcation of Income From Alimony, Child Support, or Separate Maintenance
Review the payment history to determine its suitability as stable qualifying income. To be
considered stable income, full, regular, and timely payments must have been received for six
months or longer. Income received for less than six months is considered unstable and may
not be used to qualify the borrower for the mortgage. In addition, if full or partial payments are
made on an inconsistent or sporadic basis, the income is not acceptable for the purpose of
qualifying the borrower.
Note: The lender may include alimony, child support, or separate maintenance as income only if the borrower discloses it on the Form 1003 and requests that it be considered in qualifying for the loan.
If a borrower's alimony or child support income is validated by the DU validation service, DU will issue a message indicating the required documentation. This documentation may diﬀer from the requirements described above for the veriﬁcation of the borrower's regular receipt of the full payment and its use as stable qualifying income. See B3-2-02, DU Validation Service.
Automobile Allowance
For an automobile allowance to be considered as acceptable stable income, the borrower must have received payments for at least two years. The lender must add the full amount of the allowance to the borrower’s monthly income, and the full amount of the lease or ﬁnancing expenditure to the borrower’s monthly debt obligations.
Boarder Income
Income from boarders in the borrower’s principal residence or second home is not considered acceptable stable income with the exception of the following:
When a borrower with disabilities receives rental income from a live-in personal assistant, whether or not that individual is a relative of the borrower, the rental payments can be considered as acceptable stable income in an amount up to 30% of the total gross income that is used to qualify the borrower for the mortgage loan. Personal assistants typically are paid by Medicaid Waiver funds and include room and board, from which rental payments are made to the borrower.
The HomeReady mortgage eligibility requirements include an additional exception. See Chapter B5-6, HomeReady Mortgage.
The following table provides veriﬁcation requirements for income from boarders.
Published February 5, 2025
331
✓
Veriﬁcation of Income from Boarders
Obtain documentation of the boarder’s history of shared residency (such as a copy of a
driver’s license, bills, bank statements, or W-2 forms) that shows the boarder’s address as
being the same as the borrower’s address.
Obtain documentation of the boarder’s rental payments for the most recent 12 months.
Capital Gains Income
Income received from capital gains is generally a one-time transaction; therefore, it should not be considered as part of the borrower’s stable monthly income. However, if the borrower needs to rely on income from capital gains to qualify, the income must be veriﬁed in accordance with the following requirements.
✓
Veriﬁcation of Capital Gains Income
Document a two-year history of capital gains income by obtaining copies of the borrower’s
signed federal income tax returns for the most recent two years, including IRS Form 1040,
Schedule D.
Develop an average income from the last two years (according to the Variable Income section
of B3-3.1-01, General Income Information), and use the averaged amount as part of the
borrower’s qualifying income as long as the borrower provides current evidence that
they own additional property or assets that can be sold if extra income is needed to make
future mortgage loan payments.
Note: Capital losses identiﬁed on IRS Form 1040, Schedule D, do not have to be considered
when calculating income or liabilities, even if the losses are recurring.
Due to the nature of this income, current receipt of the income is not required to comply with
the Allowable Age of Credit Documents policy. However, documentation of the asset
ownership must be in compliance with the Allowable Age of Credit Documents policy (see
B1-1-03, Allowable Age of Credit Documents and Federal Income Tax Returns, for additional
information).
Disability Income — Long-Term
The following table provides veriﬁcation requirements for long-term disability income. It does not apply to disability income that is received from the Social Security Administration. See the applicable section below for information on Social Security income.
Published February 5, 2025
332
✓
Veriﬁcation of Long-Term Disability Income
Obtain a copy of the borrower’s disability policy or beneﬁts statement from the beneﬁts payer
(insurance company, employer, or other qualiﬁed disinterested party) to determine
the borrower’s current eligibility for the disability beneﬁts,
the amount and frequency of the disability payments, and
if there is a contractually established termination or modiﬁcation date.
Generally, long-term disability will not have a deﬁned expiration date and must be expected to
continue. The requirement for re-evaluation of beneﬁts is not considered a deﬁned expiration
date.
If a borrower is currently receiving short-term disability payments that will decrease to a lesser
amount within the next three years because they are being converted to long-term beneﬁts,
the amount of the long-term beneﬁts must be used as income to qualify the borrower. For
additional information on short-term disability, see Temporary Leave Income below.
If a borrower's disability income is validated by the DU validation service, DU will issue a message indicating the required documentation. This documentation may diﬀer from the requirements described above. See B3-2-02, DU Validation Service.
Employment Oﬀers or Contracts
If the borrower is scheduled to begin employment under the terms of an employment oﬀer or contract, the lender may deliver the loan in accordance with one of the options outlined below.
✓
Option 1 -- Paystub Obtained Before Loan Delivery
The lender must obtain an executed copy of the borrower's oﬀer or contract for future
employment and anticipated income.
Note: The borrower cannot be employed by a family member or by an interested party to the
transaction.
Prior to delivering the loan, the lender must obtain a paystub from the borrower that includes
suﬃcient information to support the income used to qualify the borrower based on the oﬀer or
contract. The paystub must be retained in the mortgage loan ﬁle.
Published February 5, 2025
333
✓
Option 2 -- Paystub Not Obtained Before Loan Delivery
This option is limited to loans that meet the following criteria:
purchase transaction,
principal residence,
one-unit property,
the borrower is not employed by a family member or by an interested party to the
transaction, and
the borrower is qualiﬁed using only ﬁxed base income.
The lender must obtain and review the borrower’s oﬀer or contract for future employment. The
employment oﬀer or contract must
clearly identify the employer and the borrower, be signed by the employer, and be accepted
and signed by the borrower;
clearly identify the terms of employment, including position, type and rate of pay, and start
date; and
be non-contingent. Note: If conditions of employment exist, the lender must conﬁrm prior to
closing that all conditions of employment are satisﬁed either by verbal veriﬁcation or written
documentation. This conﬁrmation must be noted in the mortgage loan ﬁle.
Also note that for a union member who works in an occupation that results in a series of short-
term job assignments (such as a skilled construction worker, longshoreman, or stagehand), the
union may provide the executed employment oﬀer or contract for future employment.
The borrower’s start date must be no earlier than 30 days prior to the note date or no later
than 90 days after the note date.
Prior to delivery, the lender must obtain the following documentation depending on the
borrower’s employment start date:

Option 2 -- Paystub Not Obtained Before Loan Delivery
The lender must document, in addition to the amount of reserves required by DU or for the
transaction, one of the following:
Financial reserves suﬃcient to cover principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and association
dues (PITIA) for the subject property for six months; or
Financial resources suﬃcient to cover the monthly liabilities included in the debt-to-income
ratio, including the PITIA for the subject property, for the number of months between the note
date and the employment start date, plus one. For calculation purposes, consider any portion
of a month as a full month. Financial resources may include:
⚬ ﬁnancial reserves, and
⚬ current income.
Current income refers to net income that is currently being received by the borrower (or
coborrower), may or may not be used for qualifying, and may or may not continue after the
borrower starts employment under the oﬀer or contract. For this purpose, the lender may use
the amount of income the borrower is expected to receive between the note date and the
employment start date. If the current income is not being used or is not eligible to be used for
qualifying purposes, it can be documented by the lender using income documentation, such as
a paystub, but a veriﬁcation of employment is not required.
The lender must deliver the loan with Special Feature Code 707.
Employment-Related Assets as Qualifying Income
The following table provides the requirements for employment-related assets that may be used as qualifying income.
✓
Asset Requirements
Assets used for the calculation of the monthly income stream must be owned individually by
the borrower, or the co-owner of the assets must be a co-borrower of the mortgage loan.
The documentation must be in compliance with B1-1-03, Allowable Age of Credit Documents
and Federal Income Tax Returns.
Published February 5, 2025
335
✓
Asset Requirements
Assets must be liquid and available to the borrower and must be sourced as one of the
following:
A non-self-employed severance package or non-self-employed lump sum retirement package
(a lump sum distribution) — these funds must be documented with a distribution letter from
the employer (Form 1099–R) and deposited to a veriﬁed asset account.
For 401(k) or IRA, SEP, Keogh retirement accounts – the borrower must have unrestricted
access to the funds in the accounts and can only use the accounts if distribution is not already
set up or the distribution amount is not enough to qualify. The account and its asset
composition must be documented with the most recent monthly, quarterly, or annual
statement.
If a penalty would apply to a distribution of funds from the account made at the time of
calculation, then the amount of such penalty applicable to a complete distribution from the
account (after costs for the transaction) must be subtracted to determine the income stream
from these assets.
A borrower must only be considered to have unrestricted access to a 401(k) or IRA, SEP, Keogh
retirement account if the borrower has, as of the time of calculation, the unqualiﬁed and
unlimited right to request a distribution of all funds in the account (regardless of any possible
tax withholding or applicable penalty applied to such distribution).
“Net documented assets” are equal to the sum of eligible assets minus:
(a) the amount of the penalty that would apply if the account was completely distributed at
the time of calculation; and
(b) the amount of funds used for down payment, closing costs, and required reserves.
Ineligible assets are non-employment-related assets (for example, stock options, non-vested
restricted stock, lawsuits, lottery winnings, sale of real estate, inheritance, and divorce
proceeds). Checking and savings accounts are generally not eligible as employment-related
assets, unless the source of the balance in a checking or savings account was from an eligible
employment-related asset (for example, a severance package or lump sum retirement
distribution). Virtual currency is not an eligible asset.
If eligible employment-related assets have been liquidated and placed into a trust within 12
months of the loan's application date, income must be calculated in accordance with the
requirements in this table.

Foreign Income
Foreign income is income that is earned by a borrower who is employed by a foreign corporation or a foreign government and is paid in foreign currency. Borrowers may use foreign income to qualify if the following requirements are met.
✓
Veriﬁcation of Foreign Income
Copies of signed federal income tax returns for the most recent two years that include foreign
income.
The lender must satisfy the standard documentation requirements based on the source and
type of income as outlined in Chapter B3–3, Income Assessment.
All documents of a foreign origin must be completed in English, or the originator must provide
a translation, attached to each document, and ensure the translation is complete and
accurate.
Note: All income must be translated to U.S. dollars. If the borrower is not a U.S. citizen, refer
to B2-2-02, Non–U.S. Citizen Borrower Eligibility Requirements, for additional information.
Foster-Care Income
Income received from a state- or county-sponsored organization for providing temporary care for one or more children may be considered acceptable stable income if the following requirements are met.
✓
Veriﬁcation of Foster-Care Income
Verify the foster-care income with letters of veriﬁcation from the organizations providing the

Veriﬁcation of Foster-Care Income
Document that the borrower has a two-year history of providing foster-care services. If the
borrower has not been receiving this type of income for two full years, the income may still be
counted as stable income if
the borrower has at least a 12-month history of providing foster-care services, and
the income does not represent more than 30% of the total gross income that is used to
qualify for the mortgage loan.
Housing or Parsonage Allowance
A housing or parsonage allowance may be considered qualifying income if there is documentation that it has been received for the most recent 12 months and the allowance is likely to continue for the next three years. The housing allowance may be added to income but may not be used to oﬀset the monthly housing payment.
Note: This requirement does not apply to military quarters’ allowance. For information on military housing, refer to B3-3.1-03, Base Pay (Salary or Hourly), Bonus, and Overtime Income.
Interest and Dividends Income
The following table provides veriﬁcation requirements for interest and dividends income.
✓
Veriﬁcation of Income From Interest and Dividends
Verify the borrower’s ownership of the assets on which the interest or dividend income was
earned. Documentation of asset ownership must be in compliance with the Allowable Age of
Credit Documents policy (see B1-1-03, Allowable Age of Credit Documents and Federal Income
Tax Returns, for additional information).
Document a two-year history of the income, as veriﬁed by
copies of the borrower's signed federal income tax returns, or
copies of account statements.
Develop an average of the income received for the most recent two years. Refer to the
Variable Income section of B3-3.1-01, General Income Information, for additional information.
Subtract any assets used for down payment or closing costs from the borrower’s total assets
before calculating expected future interest or dividend income.
Mortgage Credit Certiﬁcates
Published February 5, 2025
339
States and municipalities can issue mortgage credit certiﬁcates (MCCs) in place of, or as part of, their authority to issue mortgage revenue bonds. MCCs enable an eligible ﬁrst-time homebuyer to obtain a mortgage secured by their principal residence and to claim a federal tax credit for a speciﬁed percentage (usually 20% to 25%) of the mortgage interest payments.
When calculating the borrower’s DTI ratio, treat the maximum possible MCC income as an addition to the borrower’s income, rather than as a reduction to the amount of the borrower’s mortgage payment. Use the following calculation when determining the available income:
[(Mortgage Amount) x (Note Rate) x (MCC %)] ÷ 12 = Amount added to borrower’s monthly income.
For example, if a borrower obtains a $100,000 mortgage that has a note rate of 7.5% and they are eligible for a 20% credit under the MCC program, the amount that should be added to their monthly income would be $125 ($100,000 x 7.5% x 20% = $1500 ÷ 12 = $125).
The lender must obtain a copy of the MCC and the lender’s documented calculation of the adjustment to the borrower’s income and include them in the loan ﬁle.
For reﬁnance transactions, the lender may allow the MCC to remain in place as long as it obtains conﬁrmation prior to loan closing from the MCC provider that the MCC remains in eﬀect for the new loan. Copies of the MCC documents, including the reissue certiﬁcation, must be maintained in the new loan ﬁle.
Note: Because the MCC is transaction speciﬁc, it does not have to comply with the Allowable Age of Credit Documents policy (see B1-1-03, Allowable Age of Credit Documents and Federal Income Tax Returns, for additional information).
Mortgage Diﬀerential Payments Income
An employer may subsidize an employee’s mortgage payments by paying all or part of the interest diﬀerential between the employee’s present and proposed mortgage payments.
When calculating the qualifying ratio, the diﬀerential payments should be added to the borrower’s gross income.
The payments may not be used to directly oﬀset the mortgage payment, even if the employer pays them to the mortgage lender rather than to the borrower.
The following table provides veriﬁcation requirements for mortgage diﬀerential payment income.
✓
Veriﬁcation of Income From Mortgage Diﬀerential Payments
Obtain written veriﬁcation from the borrower’s employer conﬁrming the subsidy and stating
the amount and duration of the payments.
Published February 5, 2025

✓
Veriﬁcation of Income From Mortgage Diﬀerential Payments
Verify that the income can be expected to continue for a minimum of three years from the
date of the mortgage application.
If this income is used on a purchase transaction, current receipt is not required to be
documented except as veriﬁed in the employer letter. For reﬁnance transactions where the
income is continuing with the new loan, the recent receipt must be in compliance with the
Allowable Age of Credit Documents policy (see B1-1-03, Allowable Age of Credit Documents
and Federal Income Tax Returns, for additional information).
Non-Occupant Borrower Income
DU will consider a non-occupant borrower’s income as qualifying income for a principal residence with certain LTV ratio limitations.
For manually underwritten loans, the income from a non-occupant borrower may be considered as acceptable qualifying income. This income can oﬀset certain weaknesses that may be in the occupant borrower’s loan application, such as limited income, ﬁnancial reserves, or limited credit history. However, it may not be used to oﬀset signiﬁcant or recent instances of major derogatory credit in the occupant borrower’s credit history. The occupant borrower must still reasonably demonstrate a willingness to make the mortgage payments and maintain homeownership. If the income from a non-occupant borrower is used for qualifying, the LTV ratios are limited.
See B2-2-04, Guarantors, Co-Signers, or Non-Occupant Borrowers on the Subject Transaction, for information about the maximum LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios that apply when non-occupant borrower income is used for qualifying purposes for both DU and manually underwritten loans.
Notes Receivable Income
The following table provides veriﬁcation requirements for notes receivable income.
✓
Veriﬁcation of Income From Notes Receivable
Verify that the income can be expected to continue for a minimum of three years from the
date of the mortgage application.
Obtain a copy of the note to establish the amount and length of payment.
Document regular receipt of income for the most recent 12 months.
Payments on a note executed within the past 12 months, regardless of the duration, may not
be used as stable income.

Public Assistance Income
The following table provides veriﬁcation requirements for public assistance income.
✓
Veriﬁcation of Public Assistance Income
Document the borrower’s receipt of public assistance income with letters or exhibits from the
paying agency that state the amount, frequency, and duration of the beneﬁt payments.
Verify that the income can be expected to continue for a minimum of three years from the
date of the mortgage application.
Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Homeownership Program Payments
The Housing Choice Voucher Homeownership Program (more commonly known as Section 8) is also an acceptable source of qualifying income. There is no requirement for the Section 8 voucher payments to have been received for any period of time prior to the date of the mortgage application or for the payments to continue for any period of time from the date of the mortgage application.
✓
Veriﬁcation of Section 8 Payment Vouchers
Determine the monthly payment amount from the public agency that issues the voucher.
Because this income is nontaxable, the lender should develop an adjusted gross income for
the borrower. See B3-3.1-01, General Income Information, for additional information.
Income from Unemployment Beneﬁts
Income from unemployment beneﬁts and any income from an employer-initiated action (such as furlough or layoﬀ) are typically short-term in nature and can be considered when qualifying the borrower in the following scenarios:
The income has been consistently received for at least two years as veriﬁed by copies of the signed federal income tax returns that reﬂect the unemployment income is associated with seasonal employment. See B3-3.1-05, Secondary Employment Income (Second Job and Multiple Jobs) and Seasonal Income, for additional information. The income from unemployment beneﬁts can be used in the calculation of ﬁnancial resources that are required under Option 2 in Employment Oﬀers and Contracts above. The income from unemployment beneﬁts may be used in qualifying a borrower for a high LTV reﬁnance loan. See B5-7-03, High LTV Reﬁnance Alternative Qualiﬁcation Path.
Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock Employment Income
Restricted stock units and restricted stock (referred to collectively as "restricted stock") are granted by an
Published February 5, 2025
342
employer to its employees as a form of compensation based on either performance or time. They can be awarded as either stock or an equivalent cash value of the number of shares awarded and usually vest over a certain number of years. After they vest, the employee may sell the shares at the current price or hold the stock for future sale.
The following table provides veriﬁcation requirements for restricted stock income.
✓
Veriﬁcation of Restricted Stock Income
To be used as qualifying income, the restricted stock must have vested and been distributed to the
borrower without restrictions.
For performance-based awards: A minimum history of 24 months restricted stock income from the
current employer is recommended. Restricted stock income received for 12 to 24 months from the
current employer may be considered as acceptable income if there are positive factors to oﬀset the
shorter income history such as
future vesting equal to or greater than previous vesting and that will continue for at least 24
months; or
restricted stock income received for the previous 5 years from any employer.
For time-based awards: A minimum history of 12 months restricted stock income from the current
employer is required.
The lender must conﬁrm continuance of income per Continuity of Income in B3-3.1-01, General
Income Information.
Note: Sign-on bonuses received in the form of restricted stock that vest over any length of time
cannot be considered by the lender as qualifying income.
The lender must document all the following:
evidence stock is publicly traded;
current vesting schedule reﬂecting past and future vesting;
brokerage or bank statement showing receipt of previous year(s) distribution of restricted stock
and, at a minimum, the number of vested shares or cash equivalent; and
a completed Request for Veriﬁcation of Employment (Form 1005) that shows restricted stock
distributions, or the borrowers recent paystub showing receipt of restricted stock income and IRS W-2
forms covering the most recent two-year period.
Published February 5, 2025
343
✓
Veriﬁcation of Restricted Stock Income
The calculation method for restricted stock income will vary depending on whether payment is made
is shares or cash.
For income paid in shares:
(200-Day Moving Average of share price x total number of distributed vested shares (pre-tax) in
most recent 24 months) / 24 months
For income paid in cash:
Total cash distributed (pre-tax) equal to the total value of vested shares in the most recent 24
months / 24 months
Note: When the borrower has a history of income ranging from 12-24 months, the lender may use the
actual number of months the borrower has received the income rather than 24 months.
See Variable Income in B3-3.1-01, General Income Information, for additional information about
calculating variable income.
Retirement, Government Annuity, and Pension Income
The following table provides veriﬁcation requirements for retirement, government annuity, and pension income.

a copy of retirement award letter or beneﬁt statement,
a copy of ﬁnancial or bank account statement,
a copy of signed federal income tax return,
an IRS W-2 form, or
an IRS 1099 form.
If income from a government annuity or a pension account will begin on or before the ﬁrst
payment date, document the income with a beneﬁt statement from the organization providing
the income. The statement must specify the income type, amount and frequency of the
payment, and include conﬁrmation of the initial start date.

Veriﬁcation of Retirement, Government Annuity, and Pension Income
If retirement income is paid in the form of a distribution from a 401(k), IRA, or Keogh
retirement account, determine whether the income is expected to continue for at least three
years after the date of the mortgage application. Eligible retirement account balances (from a
401(k), IRA, or Keogh) may be combined for the purpose of determining whether the three-
year continuance requirement is met.
Note: The borrower must have unrestricted access to the accounts without penalty.
If a borrower’s retirement, annuity, or pension income is validated by the DU validation service, DU will issue a message indicating the required documentation. This documentation may diﬀer from the requirements described above. See B3-2-02, DU Validation Service.

✓
Veriﬁcation of Schedule K-1 Income
The borrower must provide the most recent two years of
signed individual federal income tax returns, and
IRS Schedule K-1.
Income reported on Schedule K-1 can only be considered if the lender obtains documentation
verifying that
the income was actually distributed to the borrower and is consistent with the level of
business income being used to qualify, or
the business has adequate liquidity to support the withdrawal of earnings. The lender may
use discretion in the method used to conﬁrm the business has adequate liquidity.
The lender is not required to analyze the viability of the business in accordance with self-
employment requirements and may only use the borrower's proportionate share of earnings
reﬂected on Schedule K-1 when calculating the borrower's income.
If the borrower has a two-year history of receiving “guaranteed payments to the partner” from
a partnership or an LLC, these payments can be added to the borrower’s cash ﬂow.
Note: An exception to the two-year requirement of receiving “guaranteed payments to the
partner” is if a borrower has recently acquired nominal ownership in a professional services
partnership (for example, a medical practice or a law ﬁrm) after having an established
employment history with the partnership. In this situation, the lender may rely on the
borrower’s guaranteed compensation. This must be evidenced by the borrower’s partnership
agreement and further supported by evidence of current year-to-date income.

Temporary Leave Income
Temporary leave from work is generally employee-initiated, short in duration and for reasons including, but not limited to maternity or parental leave, short-term medical disability, or other temporary leave types that are acceptable by law or to the borrower's employer. Borrowers on temporary leave may or may not be paid during their absence from work.
Note: Mandatory leave initiated by an employer, such as a furlough or layoﬀ, is not considered temporary leave regardless of an expected return to work date. For income from unemployment beneﬁts received as a result of mandatory leave initiated by an employer, see Public Assistance Income above.
If a lender is made aware that a borrower will be on temporary leave at the time of the loan closing and that borrower's income is needed to qualify for the loan, the lender must determine allowable income and conﬁrm employment as described below.
✓
Temporary Leave -- Employment Requirements
The borrower's employment and income history must meet standard eligibility requirements
as described in Section B3–3.1, Employment and Other Sources of Income.
The borrower must provide written conﬁrmation of their intent to return to work.
The lender must document the borrower’s agreed-upon date of return by obtaining, either
from the borrower or directly from the employer (or a designee of the employer when the
employer is using the services of a third party to administer employee leave), documentation
evidencing such date that has been produced by the employer or by a designee of the
employer.
Examples of the documentation may include, but are not limited to, previous correspondence
from the employer or designee that speciﬁes the duration of leave or expected return date or
a computer printout from an employer or designee’s system of record. (This documentation
does not have to comply with the Allowable Age of Credit Documents policy.)
The lender must receive no evidence or information from the borrower's employer indicating
that the borrower does not have the right to return to work after the leave period.
The lender must obtain a verbal veriﬁcation of employment in accordance with B3-3.1-07,
Verbal Veriﬁcation of Employment. If the employer conﬁrms the borrower is currently on
temporary leave, the lender must consider the borrower employed.
Published February 5, 2025

✓
Temporary Leave -- Employment Requirements
The lender must verify the borrower's income in accordance with Section B3–3.1, Employment
and Other Sources of Income. The lender must obtain
the amount and duration of the borrower's “temporary leave income,” which may require
multiple documents or sources depending on the type and duration of the leave period; and
the amount of the “regular employment income” the borrower received prior to the
temporary leave. Regular employment income includes, but is not limited to, the income the
borrower receives from employment on a regular basis that is eligible for qualifying purposes
(for example, base pay, commissions, and bonus).
Note: Income veriﬁcation may be provided by the borrower, by the borrower's employer, or by
a third-party employment veriﬁcation vendor.
Requirements for Calculating Income Used for Qualifying
If the borrower will return to work as of the ﬁrst loan payment date, the lender can consider the borrower's regular employment income in qualifying.
If the borrower will not return to work as of the ﬁrst loan payment date, the lender must use the lesser of the borrower's temporary leave income (if any) or regular employment income. If the borrower's temporary leave income is less than their regular employment income, the lender may supplement the temporary leave income with available liquid ﬁnancial reserves (see B3-4.1-01, Minimum Reserve Requirements). The following are instructions on how to calculate the “supplemental income”:
Supplemental income amount = available liquid reserves divided by the number of months of supplemental income
Available liquid reserves: subtract any funds needed to complete the transaction (down payment, closing costs, other required debt payoﬀ, escrows, and minimum required reserves) from the total veriﬁed liquid asset amount.
Number of months of supplemental income: the number of months from the ﬁrst loan payment date to the date the borrower will begin receiving their regular employment income, rounded up to the next whole number.
After determining the supplemental income, the lender must calculate the total qualifying income.
Total qualifying income = supplemental income plus the temporary leave income
The total qualifying income that results may not exceed the borrower's regular employment income.
Example
Regular income amount: $6,000 per month
Temporary leave income: $2,000 per month
Total veriﬁed liquid assets: $30,000
Published February 5, 2025
349
Funds needed to complete the transaction: $18,000
Available liquid reserves: $12,000
First payment date: July 1
Date borrower will begin receiving regular employment income: November 1
Supplemental income: $12,000/4 = $3,000
Total qualifying income: $3,000 + $2,000 = $5,000
For loan caseﬁles underwritten with DU, refer to B3-3.5-01, Income and Employment Documentation for DU, for data entry guidance.
Note: These requirements apply if the lender becomes aware through the employment and income veriﬁcation process that the borrower is on temporary leave. If a borrower is not currently on temporary leave, the lender must not ask if they intend to take leave in the future.
Tip Income
The following table provides veriﬁcation requirements for tip income.
✓
Veriﬁcation of Tip Income
Obtain the following documents:
a completed Request for Veriﬁcation of Employment (Form 1005), or
the borrower’s recent paystub, and
IRS W-2 forms covering the most recent two-year period or the most recent two years tax
returns with IRS Form 4137, Social Security and Medicare Tax on Unreported Tip Income, to
verify tips not reported by the employer.
See B3-3.1-02, Standards for Employment Documentation, for additional information.
Tip income may be used to qualify the borrower if the lender veriﬁes that the borrower has
received it for the last two years.
The lender must determine the amount of tip income that may be considered in qualifying the
borrower. Refer to the Variable Income section of B3-3.1-01, General Income Information, for
additional information.
Trust Income
The following table provides veriﬁcation requirements for trust income.
Published February 5, 2025
350
✓
The lender must...
Obtain one or more of the following trust veriﬁcation documents to conﬁrm the amount, frequency, type of income being received, and the date the trust was created:
a copy of the trust agreement,
the trustee’s statement,
the trust's federal income tax returns, or
a letter from an accountant or attorney who reviewed the trust documents, when the above documents are not available or when the borrower is the trustee.
Note: A borrower who is also a trustee may not supply the trustee's statement.
Conﬁrm the trust was established for 12 months or longer, unless all of the following requirements are met:
the trust veriﬁcation documentation reﬂects ﬁxed payments,
the borrower is not the grantor, and
at least one payment is received prior to closing.
Trusts created in the previous 12 months using a borrower's eligible employment-related assets, as deﬁned in Employment-Related Assets as Qualifying Income, may still be
used as stable income but must meet the income calculation and all other requirements in Employment-Related Assets as Qualifying Income.
Conﬁrm continuance of income per Continuity of Income in B3-3.1-01, General Income Information. This conﬁrmation must be based on the type of income received through
the trust. For example, if the income from the trust is derived from rental income, then three-year continuance is not required. However, if the income is a ﬁxed payment
derived from a depleting asset, then three-year continuance must be determined.
If any assets from the trust are being used for down payment, closing costs, or reserves, those assets must be subtracted from the total amount before determining if the trust
income meets the Continuity of Income requirements.
Requirements for Trust with Fixed Payments
Requirements for Trust with Variable Payments
Calculate the qualifying income amount per Variable Income in B3-3.1-01, General
Income Information.
Document the following:
Use the ﬁxed payment amount from the trust veriﬁcation documentation as the

borrower's qualifying income, converting it to a monthly amount, as applicable.
signed federal tax income tax returns for the most recent two years or copies of the
Document current receipt of trust income with one month's bank statement or other
trust's federal income tax returns for the most recent two years, and
equivalent documentation.
current receipt of trust income with one month's bank statement or other
equivalent documentation.
Note: Income received for 12 to 24 months may be considered as acceptable
income when other positive factors are present that reasonably oﬀset a shorter
income history.
VA Beneﬁts Income
The following table provides veriﬁcation requirements for income from VA beneﬁts.
Note: Education beneﬁts are not acceptable income because they are oﬀset by education expenses.
✓
Veriﬁcation of VA Beneﬁts Income
Document the borrower’s receipt of VA beneﬁts with a letter or distribution form from the VA.
Verify that the income can be expected to continue for a minimum of three years from the
date of the mortgage application. (Veriﬁcation is not required for VA retirement or long-term
disability beneﬁts.)
If a borrower's VA beneﬁt income is validated by the DU validation service, DU will issue a message indicating the required documentation. This documentation may diﬀer from the requirements described above. See
Published February 5, 2025
351
B3-2-02, DU Validation Service.
1
An SSA Award letter may be used to document the income if the borrower is receiving Social Security payments or if the borrower will begin receiving payments on or before the ﬁrst payment date of the subject mortgage as conﬁrmed by a recently issued award letter.
2
Examples of how a borrower might draw Social Security beneﬁts from another person’s account/work record and use the income for qualifying:
A borrower may be eligible for beneﬁts from a spouse, ex-spouse, or dependent parents (the beneﬁt is paid to the borrower on behalf of the spouse, etc.); or
A borrower may use Social Security income received by a dependent (a minor or disabled dependent).
3
If joint tax returns or tax transcripts include income that is not associated with a borrower on the loan transaction, the lender must obtain additional documentation supporting the amount of income from the SSA being used in qualifying, such as the SSA-1099.
4
Conﬁrmation of three-year continuance does not require documentation that provides a deﬁned expiration date and can be assessed by verifying the SSA's requirements related to the speciﬁc beneﬁt(s) being paid. For example, if the SSA ties receipt of the beneﬁts to the beneﬁciary's age, conﬁrmation of a three-year continuance can be met by verifying that the beneﬁciary's age supports that beneﬁt(s) will continue for at least three years from the date of the loan application.

Verbal Veriﬁcation of Employment
Overview
When determining the appropriate qualifying income for a self-employed borrower, it is important to note that business income (speciﬁcally from a partnership or S corporation) reported on an individual IRS Form 1040 may not necessarily represent income that has actually been distributed to the borrower. The fundamental exercise, when conducting a self-employment income cash ﬂow analysis, is to determine the amount of income that can be relied on by the borrower in qualifying for their personal mortgage obligation. When underwriting these borrowers, it is important to review business income distributions that have been made or could be made to these borrowers while maintaining the viability of the underlying business. This analysis includes assessing the stability of business income and the ability of the business to continue to generate suﬃcient income to enable these borrowers to meet their ﬁnancial obligations.
Factors to Consider for a Self-Employed Borrower
Any individual who has a 25% or greater ownership interest in a business is considered to be self-employed.
The following factors must be analyzed before approving a loan for a self-employed borrower:
the stability of the borrower’s income,
the location and nature of the borrower’s business,
the demand for the product or service oﬀered by the business,
the ﬁnancial strength of the business, and
the ability of the business to continue generating and distributing suﬃcient income to enable the borrower to make the payments on the requested loan.
Length of Self-Employment
Fannie Mae generally requires lenders to obtain a two-year history of the borrower’s prior earnings as a means of demonstrating the likelihood that the income will continue to be received.
However, the income of a person who has less than a two-year history of self-employment may be considered, as long as the borrower’s most recent signed personal and business federal income tax returns reﬂect a full year (12 months) of self-employment income from the current business. The loan ﬁle must also contain documentation to support the history of receipt of prior income at the same (or greater) level and
in a ﬁeld that provides the same products or services as the current business, or in an occupation in which they had similar responsibilities to those undertaken in connection with the current business.
In such cases, the lender must give careful consideration to the nature of the borrower’s level of experience, and the amount of debt the business has acquired.
Published February 5, 2025
356
Veriﬁcation of Income
The lender may verify a self-employed borrower’s employment and income by obtaining from the borrower copies of their signed federal income tax returns (both individual returns and in some cases, business returns) that were ﬁled with the IRS for the past two years (with all applicable schedules attached).
Alternatively, the lender may use IRS-issued transcripts of the borrower’s individual and business federal income tax returns that were ﬁled with the IRS for the most recent two years—as long as the information provided is complete and legible and the transcripts include the information from all of the applicable schedules. (See B3-3.1-06, Requirements and Uses of IRS IVES Request for Transcript of Tax Return Form 4506-C.)
The lender may provide one year of personal and business tax returns if the following requirements are met:
the business from which the borrower is using self-employed income must have been in existence for ﬁve years as reﬂected on the Form 1003, and the borrower has had an ownership share of 25% or more for the past ﬁve years consecutively, and
for partnerships, S corporations and corporations, the federal income tax return for the business must support the information reﬂected on the Form 1003. If the business was in existence prior to the borrower having 25% or more ownership, then the lender must demonstrate the borrower has had 25% or more ownership for at least ﬁve years consecutively.
for sole proprietorships, the individual federal tax return and any other documentation or information received must support the information reﬂected on the Form 1003 for the number of years the business has been in existence.
all businesses are assessed separately for the ﬁve-years in existence benchmark and the number of years of personal and federal income tax returns required could diﬀer when there are multiple self- employment income sources.
the lender must complete Fannie Mae’s Cash Flow Analysis (Form 1084) or any other type of cash ﬂow analysis form that applies the same principles. A copy of the written analysis must be included in the permanent loan ﬁle.
Note: Alternative documentation to establish the number of years the borrower has ownership of 25% or more in a business may be obtained as long as the documentation clearly identiﬁes the speciﬁc business listed on the Form 1003 and is supported by the most recent year tax returns. Documentation must be obtained through a reliable source, such as an IRS-Issued Employer Identiﬁcation Number Conﬁrmation letter, business license, articles of incorporation, or partnership agreements.
When two years of signed individual federal tax returns are provided, the lender may waive the requirement for business tax returns if:
the borrower is using personal funds to pay down payment and closing costs and satisfy applicable reserve requirements, the borrower has been self-employed in the same business for at least ﬁve years (requirements noted above), and the borrower's individual tax returns show an increase in self-employment income over the past two years from the respective business.

Analysis of Borrower’s Personal Income
The lender must prepare a written evaluation of its analysis of a self-employed borrower’s personal income, including the business income or loss, reported on the borrower’s individual income tax returns. The purpose of this written analysis is to determine the amount of stable and continuous income that will be available to the borrower. This is not required when a borrower is qualiﬁed using only income that is not derived from self- employment and self-employment is a secondary and separate source of income (or loss). Examples of income not derived from self-employment include salary and retirement income.
The lender may use Cash Flow Analysis ( Form 1084), another type of cash ﬂow analysis, or an automated tool such as Fannie Mae-approved vendor tools or the Income Calculator, that apply the same principles as Form 1084. A copy of the written analysis and conclusions or the Findings Report generated by Income Calculator must be retained in the loan ﬁle.
The lender may receive representation and warranty enforcement relief of the calculated amount if certain requirements are met. See A2-2-04, Limited Waiver and Enforcement Relief of Representations and Warranties for additional information.
Analysis of Borrower’s Business Income
When a borrower is relying upon self-employed income to qualify for a loan and the requirements that permit the lender to waive business tax returns are not met, the lender must prepare a written evaluation of its analysis of the borrower’s business income. The lender must evaluate the borrower’s business through its knowledge of other businesses in the same industry to conﬁrm the stability of the borrower’s business income and estimate the potential for long-term earnings.
The purpose of this analysis is to:
consider the recurring nature of the business income, including identiﬁcation of pass-through income that may require additional evaluation;
measure year-to-year trends for gross income, expenses, and taxable income for the business;
determine (on a yearly or interim basis) the percentage of gross income attributed to expenses and taxable income; and
determine a trend for the business based on the change in these percentages over time.
The lender may use Fannie Mae’s Comparative Income Analysis (Form 1088), Fannie Mae's Income Calculator, or any other method of trend analysis that enables it to determine a business’s viability, as long as the method used fairly presents the viability of the business and results in a degree of accuracy and a conclusion that is comparable to that which would be reached by use of Form 1088.
A copy of the written analysis and conclusions or the Findings Report generated by Income Calculator must be retained in the loan ﬁle.
Use of Income Calculator
Published February 5, 2025
358
The lender may use Income Calculator to calculate the monthly qualifying income from self-employment. Income Calculator will provide a complete analysis of self-employment income for each borrower on a business- by-business basis and produce a Findings Report. This tool can be used for loans underwritten manually or loan caseﬁles submitted to DU.
The Income Calculator Findings Report summarizes the overall qualifying income amount, trending analysis, business liquidity, and provides speciﬁc messaging for each business evaluation. These detailed messages are designed to assist lenders in processing and underwriting self-employed borrowers while providing certainty of the income calculation. See B3-3.1-10, Income Calculator for additional information.
Use of Business Assets
When a borrower is using self-employment income to qualify for the loan and also intends to use assets from their business as funds for the down payment, closing costs, and/or ﬁnancial reserves, the lender must perform a business cash ﬂow analysis to conﬁrm that the withdrawal of funds for this transaction will not have a negative impact on the business. To assess the impact, the lender may require a level of documentation greater than what is required to evaluate the borrower’s business income (for example, several months of recent business asset statements in order to see cash ﬂow needs and trends over time, or a current balance sheet). This may be due to the amount of time that has elapsed since the most recent tax return ﬁling, or the lender’s need for information to perform its analysis. See B3-4.2-02, Depository Accounts, for requirements when self- employment income is not being used to qualify, but business assets are being used for the down payment, closing costs, and/or ﬁnancial reserves.
Income Veriﬁcation for Self-Employed Co-Borrowers
When co-borrower income that is derived from self-employment is not being used for qualifying purposes, the lender is not required to document or evaluate the co-borrower’s self-employment income (or loss). Any business debt on which the borrower is personally obligated must be included in the total monthly obligations when calculating the debt-to-income ratio.

B3-3.2-02, Business Structures (12/16/2014)
Introduction This topic contains information on various types of business structures, including:
Overview Sole Proprietorships Partnerships Limited Liability Companies S Corporations Corporations
Overview
The legal structure of a business determines the following:
the way business income or loss is reported to the IRS,
the taxes that are paid,
the ability of the business to accumulate capital, and
the extent of the owner’s liability.
There are ﬁve principal business structures: sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited liability companies (LLCs), S corporations, and corporations. Knowledge of the structure of a self-employed borrower’s business will assist the lender in analyzing and evaluating the stability of the business and the degree of the borrower’s involvement.
Note: Refer to B3-3.2-03, IRS Forms Quick Reference, for a summary of the IRS forms referenced in this section and their full titles.
Sole Proprietorships
A sole proprietorship is an unincorporated business that is individually owned and managed. The individual owner has unlimited personal liability for all debts of the business. If the business fails, the borrower not only
Published February 5, 2025
360
will have to replace their lost income, but also will be expected to satisfy the outstanding obligations of the business. Since no distinction is made between the owner’s personal assets and the assets used in the business, creditors may take either (or both) to satisfy the borrower’s business obligations.
The ﬁnancial success or failure of this type of business depends solely on the owner’s ability to obtain capital and to manage the various aspects of the business. Poor management skills or an inability to secure capital to keep the business running will compromise the continuance of the borrower’s business (and income). The owner’s death terminates the business and may cause the assets to be placed into probate, thus delaying the disposition of the assets to creditors and heirs.
The income, expenses, and taxable proﬁts of a sole proprietorship are reported on the owner’s IRS Form 1040, Schedule C, and are taxed at the tax rates that apply to individuals. (See B3-3.3-03, Income or Loss Reported on IRS Form 1040, Schedule C.)
When evaluating a sole proprietorship, the lender must:
review the owner’s most recent signed federal income tax returns to ensure that there is suﬃcient and stable cash ﬂow to support both the business and the payments for the requested mortgage, and
determine whether the business can accommodate the withdrawal of assets or revenues should the borrower need them to pay the mortgage payment and/or other personal expenses.
Partnerships
A partnership is an arrangement between two or more individuals who have pooled their assets and skills to form a business and who will share proﬁts and losses according to predetermined proportions that are set out in the partnership agreement. A partnership may be either a general partnership or a limited partnership:
General Partnership — Under a general partnership, each partner has responsibility for running the business, is personally liable for the debts of the entire business, and is responsible for the actions of every other partner (unless otherwise speciﬁed in the partnership agreement). A general partnership is dissolved immediately on the death, withdrawal, or insolvency of any of the partners, although the personal liability to partnership creditors exists even after the partnership is dissolved. However, the partnership’s assets will ﬁrst be applied to the creditors of the business and the partners’ individual assets will be ﬁrst be applied to their personal creditors, with any surplus in a partner’s personal assets then being applied to the remaining business creditors.
Limited Partnership — Under a limited partnership, a limited partner has limited liability based on the amount they invested in the partnership, does not typically participate in the management and operation of the business, and has limited decision-making ability. A limited partnership will have at least one general partner who manages the business and is personally liable for the debts of the entire business. A limited partner’s death, withdrawal, or insolvency does not dissolve the partnership. Because limited partnerships often are formed as tax shelters, it is more likely that IRS Form 1065, Schedule K-1, will reﬂect a loss instead of income. In such cases, the borrower’s ability to deduct the loss will be limited by the “at risk” amount of their limited partnership interest (and will probably be subject to passive loss limitations).
The partnership must report its proﬁt or loss on IRS Form 1065 and each partner’s share of the proﬁt or loss on IRS Form 1065, Schedule K-1; however, the partnership pays no tax on the partnership income.
Published February 5, 2025
361
Each partner uses the information from IRS Form 1065, Schedule K-1, to report their share of the partnership’s net proﬁt or loss (and special deductions and credits) on their IRS Form 1040—whether or not the partner receives a cash distribution from the partnership. Individual partners pay taxes on their proportionate share of the net partnership income at their individual tax rates.
To quantify the level of the borrower’s ﬁnancial risk, the lender must:
determine whether the borrower has guaranteed any loans obtained by the partnership (other than loans that are considered as nonrecourse debt or qualiﬁed nonrecourse debt),
determine if the borrower received a distribution from the partnership, and
determine the borrower’s share of non-cash expenses that can be added back to the cash ﬂow of the partnership business.
For additional information, see the following:
B3-3.3-07, Income or Loss Reported on IRS Form 1065 or IRS Form 1120S, Schedule K-1
B3-3.4-01, Analyzing Partnership Returns for a Partnership or LLC
Limited Liability Companies
A limited liability company (LLC) is a hybrid business structure that is designed to oﬀer its member-owners the tax eﬃciencies of a partnership and the limited liability advantages of a corporation. The member-owners of the LLC (or their assigned managers) can sign contracts, sell assets, and make other important business decisions. The LLC operating agreement may set out speciﬁc divisions of power among the member-owners (or managers). Although the member-owners generally have limited liability, there may be some instances in which they are required to personally guarantee some of the loans that the LLC obtains. Proﬁts from the operation of the LLC may be distributed beyond the pool of member-owners, such as by oﬀering proﬁt distributions to managers.
The LLC may report its proﬁt or loss on IRS Form 1065 or IRS Form 1120S with each member-owner’s share of the proﬁt or loss on Schedule K-1, IRS Form 1065 or IRS Form 1120S; however, the LLC pays no tax on its income. Each member-owner uses the information from Schedule K-1 to report their share of the LLC’s net proﬁt or loss (and special deductions and credits) on their individual IRS Form 1040, whether or not the member- owner receives a cash distribution from the LLC. Individual member-owners pay taxes on their proportionate share of the LLC’s net income at their individual tax rates.
The lender must evaluate the LLC using IRS Form 1065 or IRS Form 1120S along with the Schedule K-1, as applicable, to determine the following:
whether the borrower actually received a cash distribution from the LLC, since proﬁts may or may not be distributed to the individual member-owners; and
whether the borrower has guaranteed any loans obtained by the LLC (other than loans that are considered as nonrecourse debt or qualiﬁed nonrecourse debt).

S Corporations
An S corporation is a legal entity that has a limited number of stockholders and elects not to be taxed as a regular corporation. Business gains and losses are passed on to the stockholders. An S corporation has many of the characteristics of a partnership. Stockholders are taxed at their individual tax rates for their proportionate share of ordinary income, capital gains, and other taxable items.
The ordinary income for an S corporation is reported on IRS Form 1120S, with each shareholder’s share of the income reported on IRS Form 1120S, Schedule K-1.
Because this income from the distribution of corporate earnings may or may not be distributed to the individual shareholders, the lender must determine if the borrower received a cash distribution from the S corporation.
The cash ﬂow of an S corporation is otherwise evaluated similarly to that of a regular corporation.
For additional information, see the following:
B3-3.3-07, Income or Loss Reported on IRS Form 1065 or IRS Form 1120S, Schedule K-1
B3-3.4-02, Analyzing Returns for an S Corporation
Corporations
A corporation is a state-chartered legal entity that exists separately and distinctly from its owners (who are called stockholders or shareholders). It is the most ﬂexible form of business organization for purposes of obtaining capital. A corporation can sue; be sued; hold, convey, or receive property; enter into contracts under its own name; and does not dissolve when its ownership changes. There are two types of corporations—publicly owned (widely held) corporations and privately owned (closely held) corporations. Because more than 50% of the outstanding stock of a privately owned corporation is owned directly or indirectly by no more than ﬁve people, the corporation has little or no access to public funds and must raise capital through institutional ﬁnancing.
Although legal control of the corporation rests with its stockholders, they typically are not responsible for the day-to-day operations of the business since they elect a board of directors to manage the corporation and delegate responsibility for the day-to-day operations to the directors and oﬃcers of the company. The distribution of proﬁts earned by the business is determined by the corporation’s board of directors or other entities that have a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial interest in the business. However, the proﬁts usually are ﬁltered down to the owners in the form of dividends. Since a stockholder is not personally liable for the debts of the corporation, losses are limited to their individual investment in the corporation’s stock.
Corporations must report income and losses on IRS Form 1120 and pay taxes on the net income. The corporation distributes proﬁts to its shareholders in the form of dividends, which it reports on IRS Form 1099- DIV. The shareholders must then report the dividends as income on their individual IRS Form 1040.

Analyzing Individual Tax Returns
Analyzing Individual Tax Returns
In analyzing a self-employed borrower’s personal income, the lender should focus on earnings trends and the actual sources of the income, not just on the total amount of the income. The lender must conﬁrm the stability and likelihood of continuance for each source of income that the borrower reports on their IRS Form 1040. The lender should not include any income that does not appear to be stable or likely to continue. The lender should, however, consider all recurring income that the borrower can expect to continue receiving over time.
Income may be considered as recurring if the loan application package does not include any speciﬁc indication of an upcoming change in the borrower’s employment or income, the borrower’s employment history has no gaps or other signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations in income, and any income received under a contractual agreement (other than an “at will” contract) will continue to be received for at least three years.
Examples of recurring income include:
regular salaries or wages,
bonus or commission income that has been received on a consistent basis,
interest income from long-term investments that are not being liquidated in connection with the mortgage transaction, and
earnings from the operation of the borrower’s business.
Any nonrecurring loss (such as an extraordinary one-time expense) should not be included in the cash ﬂow analysis; therefore, in developing the borrower’s qualifying income, the lender should adjust the borrower’s cash ﬂow by the amount of any nonrecurring loss.

Introduction This topic contains information on income reported on IRS Form 1040, including:
Overview Wages, Salary, and Tips Interest and Dividend Income State and Local Tax Refunds Alimony Received IRA Distributions, Pensions and Annuities, and Social Security Beneﬁts Unemployment Compensation Other Income (or Loss)
Overview
To get an accurate picture of the borrower’s cash ﬂow, the lender will need to make certain adjustments to some of the income (or loss) that the borrower reported on IRS Form 1040 since it may not be recurring income. The lender also may need to further analyze the accompanying tax schedules or supplemental tax forms.
This section describes how the lender should treat various components of the income (or loss) that a self- employed borrower reported on IRS Form 1040 in its cash ﬂow analysis.
Note: Eligibility criteria for accepting income from speciﬁc non-business sources is generally the same as that for salaried or commissioned borrowers (see B3-3.1-01, General Income Information).
Wages, Salary, and Tips
If an amount is shown for wages, salary, or tips for a self-employed borrower, it may mean:
the borrower operates as a corporation and pays himself or herself a salary or
the borrower’s spouse is employed and receives a salary (either from the borrower’s business or from another employer).
Published February 5, 2025
367
If the income relates to the borrower’s spouse who is employed by another company and the income will be used in qualifying for the mortgage, the spouse’s income must be veriﬁed directly with their employer since it may be more appropriate to use the spouse’s current earnings in underwriting the mortgage. Any income that is based on current earnings or that will not be used for qualifying purposes should be deducted from the borrower’s cash ﬂow.
Interest and Dividend Income
The taxable interest and dividend income that is reported on IRS Form 1040, Schedule B, may be counted as stable income only if it has been received for the past two years. However, the income cannot be counted if the borrower is using the interest-bearing or dividend-producing asset as the source of the down payment or closing costs.
Any taxable interest or dividend income that is not recurring must be deducted from the borrower’s cash ﬂow.
Tax-exempt interest income may be counted as stable income only if it has been received for the past two years and is expected to continue. If so, this income can be added to the borrower’s cash ﬂow.
State and Local Tax Refunds
Taxable state and local tax refunds, credits, or oﬀsets of state and local income taxes should not be used as qualifying income since the income was accounted for in the previous year’s tax returns. Therefore, the borrower’s cash ﬂow must be adjusted accordingly.
Alimony Received
Alimony may be accepted as qualifying income if it meets the requirements described in B3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income. Any reported alimony received that is determined to be nonrecurring must be deducted from the borrower’s total income reported on IRS Form 1040.
IRA Distributions, Pensions and Annuities, and Social Security Beneﬁts
Income received from IRA distributions, pensions, annuities, and Social Security beneﬁts may be accepted as qualifying income. See B3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income, for speciﬁc requirements.
The nontaxable portion of such recurring income must be added to the borrower’s cash ﬂow. The tax-exempt portion of income from these sources may be increased to reﬂect the tax savings, as described in B3-3.1-01, General Income Information. If the income from these sources is determined to be nonrecurring, the income must be deducted from the borrower’s cash ﬂow.
Unemployment Compensation
Unemployment compensation may be considered as acceptable qualifying income if it meets the requirements described in B3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income. Any reported unemployment compensation that is determined
Published February 5, 2025
368
to be nonrecurring must be deducted from the borrower’s cash ﬂow.
Other Income (or Loss)
If the borrower reported income from other sources, the lender must verify that the income is an eligible source for qualifying purposes per the requirements described in B3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income, for the applicable income source. Income that is determined to be nonrecurring or ineligible for qualifying purposes must be deducted from the borrower’s cash ﬂow. If the borrower reported any nonrecurring losses, the borrower’s cash ﬂow should be increased by the amount of the losses.

Income (or Loss) from a Sole Proprietorship
The income (or loss) from a borrower’s sole proprietorship is calculated on IRS Form 1040, Schedule C, then transferred to IRS Form 1040.
The lender may need to make certain adjustments to the net proﬁt or loss shown on Schedule C to arrive at the borrower’s cash ﬂow. For example, Schedule C may include income that was not obtained from the proﬁts of the borrower’s business. If the lender determines that such income is not recurring, it should adjust the borrower’s cash ﬂow by deducting the nonrecurring income.
See B3-3.2-02, Business Structures, for more information on sole proprietorships.
Recurring vs. Non-recurring Income and Expenses

Overview Calculating Borrower Cash Flow from Schedule D and Required Documentation
Overview
IRS Form 1040, Schedule D, is used to report capital gains and losses. Income received from a capital gain is generally a one-time transaction; therefore, it should not usually be considered part of the borrower’s stable monthly income.
Calculating Borrower Cash Flow from Schedule D and Required Documentation
If the income calculated on the Schedule D shows that the borrower has realized capital gains for the last two years, as may be the case when the borrower’s business has a constant turnover of assets that produces regular gains, the recurring gains can be considered in determining the borrower’s stable monthly income. In this case, the borrower must provide evidence of ownership of additional property or assets that can be sold if extra income is needed to make future mortgage payments.
The table below provides the requirements for calculating cash ﬂow from Schedule D and the associated required documentation.

(09/30/2014)
Introduction This topic contains information on income or loss reported on IRS Form 1040, Schedule E, including:
Overview Royalty Income Rental Income
Overview
Income received from rents, royalties, and distributions from partnerships, corporations, estates, trusts, etc., is calculated on IRS Form 1040, Schedule E, and transferred to IRS Form 1040.
Rather than using Schedule E for income related to distributions from partnerships, corporations, estates, and trusts, the lender should rely on Schedule K-1 (see B3-3.3-07, Income or Loss Reported on IRS Form 1065 or IRS Form 1120S, Schedule K-1).
Royalty Income
Published February 5, 2025
371
Schedule E should be used to determine the supplemental income to use for royalties. The lender must include the total amount of royalty payments received, and must document the borrower’s receipt of royalty income for 12 months and the likelihood of continued receipt of such income for at least three years (see B3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income)
Rental Income
If rental income is reported on Schedule E, only the rental income that relates to properties shown on the Schedule of Real Estate Owned on the borrower’s loan application should be included.
All regular and ongoing expenses for the properties, such as maintenance, advertising, management fees, utilities, homeowners’ association dues, and supply costs, should be subtracted from the borrower’s cash ﬂow.
Depending on the approach used to calculate cash ﬂow, adjustments will need to be made for depreciation and any one-time extraordinary expenses, such as the costs of repairing damage that resulted from a natural disaster.
In most situations, the full amount of the mortgage payment for a rental property will be factored into the net rental income calculation, but it may also be counted as part of the liabilities that are considered in the calculation of the borrower’s total debt-to-income ratio. Therefore, the lender must add back any portion of the mortgage payment, including interest, taxes, and insurance, necessary to avoid double counting of these expenses.
The lender must pay particular attention to the eﬀect of “passive loss” limitations or prior “carryovers” related to the borrower’s rental properties and, depending on the method it uses for the cash ﬂow analysis, make any special adjustments necessary to account for them.

Published February 5, 2025
372
Note: Other income on Schedule F may represent income that is not obtained from the borrower’s farming operations.
The lender may need to make certain adjustments to the net income amount that was transferred to IRS Form 1040. For example, certain federal agricultural program payments, co-op distributions, and insurance or loan proceeds are not fully taxable, so they would not be reported on IRS Form 1040. These income sources may or may not be stable or continuous and could be a one-time occurrence.
If the lender veriﬁes that the net income amounts that were transferred to IRS Form 1040 are stable, consistent, and continuing, the borrower’s cash ﬂow must be adjusted by the nontaxable portion of any recurring income from these sources. Otherwise, the income must be deducted from the borrower’s cash ﬂow.
The lender can adjust the borrower’s cash ﬂow by adding the amount of any deductions the borrower claimed on Schedule F for depreciation, amortization, casualty loss, depletion, or business use of their home.

1120S, Schedule K-1 (02/07/2024)
Introduction This topic contains information on income or loss reported on IRS Form 1065 or IRS Form 1120S, Schedule K-1, including:
Income or Loss Reported on IRS Form 1065 or IRS Form 1120S, Schedule K-1 Documentation Requirements
Income or Loss Reported on IRS Form 1065 or IRS Form 1120S, Schedule K-1
The version of Schedule K-1 that is utilized to report a borrower’s share of income (or loss) is based on how the business reports earnings for tax purposes:
partnership — reported on IRS Form 1065, Schedule K-1;
S corporation — reported on IRS Form 1120S, Schedule K-1; and
LLC — reported on either IRS Form 1065 or IRS Form 1120S, Schedule K-1, depending on how the federal income tax returns are ﬁled for the LLC.
The lender must use caution when including income that the borrower draws from the borrower’s partnership or S corporation as qualifying income. Ordinary income, net rental real estate income, and other net rental income reported on Schedule K-1 may be included in the borrower’s cash ﬂow provided the lender can conﬁrm that the business has adequate liquidity to support the withdrawal of earnings, as described below:
Published February 5, 2025
373
If the borrower has a two-year history of receiving “guaranteed payments to the partner” from a partnership or an LLC, these payments can be added to the borrower’s cash ﬂow.
If the Schedule K-1 reﬂects a documented, stable history of receiving cash distributions of income from the business consistent with the level of business income being used to qualify, then no further documentation of access to the income or adequate business liquidity is required. But if the Schedule K-1 does not reﬂect a documented, stable history, then the lender must conﬁrm adequate business liquidity, as discussed below.
If business tax returns are required, then the lender must consider the type of business structure and analyze the business returns, according to the requirements described in B3-3.2-01, Underwriting Factors and Documentation for a Self-Employed Borrower.
The lender may use discretion in selecting the method to conﬁrm that the business has adequate liquidity to support the withdrawal of earnings. When business tax returns are provided, for example, the lender may calculate a ratio using a generally accepted formula that measures business liquidity by deriving the proportion of current assets available to meet current liabilities.
It is important that the lender select a business liquidity formula based on how the business operates. For example:
The Quick Ratio (also known as the Acid Test Ratio) is appropriate for businesses that rely heavily on inventory to generate income. This test excludes inventory from current assets in calculating the proportion of current assets available to meet current liabilities.
Quick Ratio = (current assets — inventory) ÷ current liabilities
The Current Ratio (also known as the Working Capital Ratio) may be more appropriate for businesses not relying on inventory to generate income.
Current Ratio = current assets ÷ current liabilities
While a result of one or greater is generally suﬃcient to conﬁrm adequate business liquidity to support the withdrawal of earnings, lenders may support adequate liquidity using alternative methods with a documented rationale.

Overview Evaluating the Business Income Borrower’s Proportionate Share of Income or Loss Adjustments to Business Cash Flow Income from Partnerships, LLCs, Estates, and Trusts
Overview
Partnerships and some LLCs use IRS Form 1065 for ﬁling informational federal income tax returns for the partnership or LLC. The partner’s or member-owner’s share of income (or loss) is carried over to IRS Form 1040, Schedule E. See B3-3.2-02, Business Structures, for more information on partnerships and LLCs.
Published February 5, 2025
375
A borrower with an ownership interest in a partnership or LLC may receive income in the form of wages or other compensation from the partnership or LLC in addition to the borrower’s proportionate share of income (or loss) reported on the Schedule K-1.
Evaluating the Business Income
When the borrower has 25% or more ownership interest in the business and business tax returns are required, the lender must perform a business cash ﬂow analysis and evaluate the overall ﬁnancial position of the borrower’s business to determine whether
income is stable and consistent, and
sales and earnings trends are positive.
If the business does not meet these standards, business income cannot be used to qualify the borrower.
Borrower’s Proportionate Share of Income or Loss
The borrower’s proportionate share of income or loss is based on the borrower’s partnership percentage of Ending Capital in the business as shown on IRS Form 1065, Schedule K-1.
The lender can only consider the borrower’s proportionate share of the business income or loss after making the adjustments to the business cash ﬂow analysis discussed below.
Adjustments to Business Cash Flow
Items that can be added back to the business cash ﬂow include depreciation, depletion, amortization, casualty losses, and other losses that are not consistent and recurring.
The following items should be subtracted from the business cash ﬂow:
travel and meals exclusion,
other reported income that is not consistent and recurring, and
the total amount of obligations on mortgages, notes, or bonds that are payable in less than one year.
These adjustments are not required for lines of credit or if there is evidence that these obligations roll over regularly and/or the business has suﬃcient liquid assets to cover them.
Income from Partnerships, LLCs, Estates, and Trusts
Income from partnerships, LLCs, estates, or trusts can only be considered if the lender obtains documentation verifying that
the income was actually distributed to the borrower consistent with the level of business income reﬂected

Overview Corporate Fiscal Year Determining the Corporation’s Financial Position Borrower’s Share of Income or Loss Adjustments to Cash Flow
Overview
Corporations use IRS Form 1120 to report their taxes. See B3-3.2-02, Business Structures, for more information on corporations.
Corporate Fiscal Year
When funds from a corporation that operates on a ﬁscal year that is diﬀerent from the calendar year are used in qualifying a self-employed borrower, the lender must make time adjustments to relate the corporate income to the borrower’s individual tax return, which is on a calendar year basis.
Determining the Corporation’s Financial Position
After determining the income available to the borrower for qualifying purposes, the lender must evaluate the overall ﬁnancial position of the corporation. Ordinary income from the corporation can be used to qualify the borrower only if the following requirements are met:
the business income must be stable and consistent,
the sales and earnings trends must be positive, and
the business must have adequate liquidity to support the borrower’s withdrawals of cash without having severe negative eﬀects.
Borrower’s Share of Income or Loss
The cash ﬂow analysis can only consider the borrower’s share of the business income or loss, taking into consideration adjustments to business income provided below. Earnings may not be used unless the borrower owns 100% of the business.
Adjustments to Cash Flow
Items that can be added back to the business cash ﬂow include depreciation, depletion, amortization, casualty losses, net operating losses, and other special deductions that are not consistent and recurring.
The following items should be subtracted from the business cash ﬂow:
travel and meals exclusion,

Analyzing Proﬁt and Loss Statements
Analyzing Proﬁt and Loss Statements
The lender may use a proﬁt and loss statement—audited or unaudited—for a self-employed borrower’s business to support its determination of the stability or continuance of the borrower’s income. A typical proﬁt and loss statement has a format similar to IRS Form 1040, Schedule C.
A year-to-date proﬁt and loss statement is not required for most businesses, but if the borrower’s loan application is dated more than 120 days after the end of the business’s tax year, the lender may choose to require this document if it believes that it is needed to support its determination of the stability or continuance of the borrower’s income.
If the lender did not count the borrower’s year-to-date salary or draws in determining the borrower’s qualifying income, it may add them to the net proﬁt shown on the proﬁt and loss statement as well as adding any of the allowable adjustments it used in analyzing the tax returns for the business, such as nonrecurring income and expenses, depreciation, and depletion.
However, only the borrower’s proportionate share of these items may be considered in determining the amount of income from the business that the borrower can use for qualifying purposes.

Section B3-3.5, DU Requirements for Income Assessment
B3-3.5-01, Income and Employment Documentation for DU
(10/04/2023)
Introduction This topic contains information on general income and employment documentation requirements for DU, including:
General Income Documentation Requirements Reduced Income Documentation Requirements for High LTV Reﬁnance Loans Alternative Documentation Requirements for Income Validated by the DU Validation Service Base Pay (Salary or Hourly) Income Bonus and Overtime Income Commission Income Secondary Employment Income (Second Job and Multiple Jobs) Self-Employment Income Verbal Veriﬁcation of Employment Other Income Temporary Leave Income Nontaxable Income
General Income Documentation Requirements
DU indicates the minimum income veriﬁcation documentation required to process a loan application. This level of documentation may not be adequate for every borrower and every situation. The lender must determine whether additional documentation is warranted. If the lender is unable to determine the stability of the borrower’s income on the basis of the available documentation, the income must be removed and the loan resubmitted to DU.
The standards for employment documentation are the same for DU loan caseﬁles as they are for manually underwritten loans. For example, paystubs, W-2s, and tax returns must meet the same requirements without regard to the underwriting method. The following information describes DU considerations for speciﬁc types of income. For additional information, see B1-1-03, Allowable Age of Credit Documents and Federal Income Tax Returns, and Section B3–3.1, Employment and Other Sources of Income.
Note: Only actual employer information should be entered in the employment section of the loan

application. For example, do not enter “retired” or “homemaker” as the borrower’s current employer.
Reduced Income Documentation Requirements for High LTV Reﬁnance Loans
DU oﬀers a reduced level of income documentation for high LTV reﬁnance loans. Refer to B5-7-02, High LTV Reﬁnance Underwriting, Documentation, and Collateral Requirements for the New Loan, for additional information.
Alternative Documentation Requirements for Income Validated by the DU Validation Service
When a component of the loan ﬁle is validated by the DU validation service, DU will issue a message indicating the required documentation. This documentation requirement may diﬀer from those described below. See B3-2-02, DU Validation Service.
Base Pay (Salary or Hourly) Income
DU will require the following:
a completed Request for Veriﬁcation of Employment (Form 1005),
the borrower's recent paystub and IRS W-2 forms covering the most recent one-year period, or
the borrower's recent Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) for military income and entitlements.
Bonus and Overtime Income
DU will require the following:
a completed Form 1005, or
the borrower's recent paystub and IRS W-2 forms covering the most recent two-year period.
Commission Income
DU will require the following:
a completed Form 1005, or
the borrower’s recent paystub and IRS W-2 forms covering the most recent two-year period.
Secondary Employment Income (Second Job and Multiple Jobs)
When the second job income is not from self-employment, DU will require the borrower's recent paystub and IRS
Published February 5, 2025
383
W-2 forms covering the most recent two-year period.
Self-Employment Income
If the borrower is the business owner or is self-employed, the business owner/self-employed indicator must be checked in the loan application along with the percentage of ownership. DU will consider the borrower self- employed if the ownership share is 25% or more, or if the ownership share is not completed but the business owner/self-employed indicator is checked. If the ownership share is 25% or more, the income is entered in Monthly Income (or Loss) based on the lender’s calculation of net income (or loss) from self-employment. If the ownership share is less than 25%, the income is entered in Gross Monthly Income (base, bonus, overtime, etc.). Schedule K-1 income for these borrowers should be entered as Other in Gross Monthly Income.
For DU loan caseﬁles where two years of the most recent signed personal and two years of the most recent signed business federal income tax returns are required, business tax returns do not have to be provided unless the business is a corporation, an S corporation, a limited liability company, or a partnership. Under certain conditions, the requirements for business tax returns may be waived.
DU will issue a message permitting only one year of personal federal tax returns if the loan application indicates the borrower is self-employed with an ownership share of 25% or more, and the Start Date for all self-employed businesses is at least ﬁve years prior to the Caseﬁle Create Date. If any of the borrower's self-employed businesses have a Start Date less than ﬁve years, DU will require two years of personal tax returns. DU will issue a separate message listing the requirements for business tax returns for all self-employed businesses, specifying that one- or two-years of tax returns are required based on the number of years the business has been in existence (determined by comparing the Start Date to the Caseﬁle Create Date).
Refer to B3-3.2-01, Underwriting Factors and Documentation for a Self-Employed Borrower for additional information and requirements related to underwriting, documenting, and calculating self-employed income.
Verbal Veriﬁcation of Employment
A verbal VOE is required for each employer. For requirements regarding verbal VOEs, see B3-3.1-07, Verbal Veriﬁcation of Employment.
Other Income
Other income must be entered in the loan application. DU supports a number of other income types. Income types not available in DU must be entered as “Other” income.
Refer to B3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income, B3-3.1-05, Secondary Employment Income (Second Job and Multiple Jobs) and Seasonal Income, and B5-6-02, HomeReady Mortgage Underwriting Methods and Requirements, for information on eligibility and veriﬁcation of other sources of income.
Temporary Leave Income
Published February 5, 2025
384
When income from temporary leave is being used to qualify for the mortgage loan, the lender must enter the appropriate qualifying income amount into DU based on the requirements provided in B3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income.
If the borrower will return to work as of the ﬁrst mortgage payment date, the lender can consider the borrower's regular employment income in qualifying and must enter the income into DU using the applicable income type.
If the borrower will not return to work as of the ﬁrst mortgage payment date, but is able to qualify using the lesser of the borrower's temporary leave income (if any) or regular employment income, that “lesser of” income amount must be entered into DU. Entry of the income into DU depends on what was derived as the “lesser of” amount:
When the borrower's temporary leave income is used, enter the income amount into DU using the other income type Temporary Leave.
When the borrower's regular employment income is used, enter the income amount in DU using the applicable income type.
If the borrower's temporary leave income is less than the regular employment income and the lender is able to “supplement” the temporary income with available liquid reserves (per B3-3.1-09, Other Sources of Income), the following must be applied:
The lender must enter the combined temporary leave income and supplemental income from reserves in DU using the other income type Temporary Leave. The combination of these two incomes may not exceed the borrower's regular monthly employment income.
As DU is not able to determine that supplemental income is being used, nor is it able to determine the amount of reserves used to supplement the temporary income, the lender must manually reduce the amount of the borrower's total liquid assets by the amount of reserves used to supplement the temporary income (in order to avoid the reserves being used for both income and assets).
Nontaxable Income
DU does not provide any unique messaging identifying the use of adjusted gross income.
See B3-3.1-01, General Income Information, for guidance on how to calculate adjusted gross income for nontaxable income. This topic also deﬁnes the requirements that nontaxable income must meet to be considered for qualifying purposes in DU. If these requirements are not met, the borrower’s income must be adjusted downward.
Note: Certain loan origination systems oﬀer an automatic calculation of adjusted gross income when nontaxable income types are entered in the loan application.

mortgage loan(s). The following rental income policies apply to properties that are not the subject property. For rental income policies on the subject property, see Entering Rental Income in DU for the Subject Property below.
Investment Property
When submitting rental income to DU for an investment property:
The lender should calculate the net rental income amount for each property and enter the amount (either positive or negative) in the Net Monthly Rental Income in Section 3.
If the Net Monthly Rental Income is a “breakeven” amount, the user must enter either $0.01 or $-0.01.
If Net Monthly Rental Income is not entered or is $0.00, DU will calculate it using this formula:
(Gross rental income multiplied by 75%) minus property PITIA expense
The lender can override DU’s calculation by entering the Net Monthly Rental Income amount in Section 3.
Two- to four-unit Principal Residence
When submitting rental income to DU for the borrower’s principal residence that is a two- to four-unit property:
The lender should calculate the net rental income amount for the property and enter the amount in Net Monthly Rental Income in Section 3.
The net rental income calculation is not reduced by the mortgage payment, which is always treated as a liability and included in the debt-to-income ratio.
If Net Monthly Rental Income is not entered or is $0.00, DU will calculate it using this formula:
Gross rental income multiplied by 75%
The lender can override DU’s calculation by entering the Net Monthly Rental Income amount in Section 3.
If the combined total Net Monthly Rental Income for all properties is positive, DU adds the net rental income to the qualifying income. If the total is negative, DU treats the loss as a liability and includes it in the debt-to- income ratio.
Refer to the Desktop Underwriter Job Aids (Troubleshooting - DTI Ratio Calculations Questions) for additional details on entry of real estate and rental income.
Conversion of Principal Residence to Investment Property
If the borrower is purchasing a principal residence and is retaining their current residence as a rental property, the current principal residence must be identiﬁed in Section 3 by entering Retained (Status ﬁeld) and Investment (Intended Occupancy ﬁeld).
Net rental income to be earned on the property may also be entered and used to qualify in accordance with the above requirements.
Entering Rental Income in DU for the Subject Property
The following rental income policies apply to properties that are the subject property. Refer to B3-3.1-08, Rental
Published February 5, 2025
387
Income to determine the maximum amount of rental income that can be used for qualifying purposes for the subject property.
Investment property: Calculate the net rental income using the PITIA. If it is positive, it will be added to qualifying income. If it is negative, enter a negative value. DU treats the loss as a liability and includes it in the debt-to-income ratio. If income from the subject property is not used for qualifying purposes, the lender should enter the entire proposed PITIA as a negative amount.
Two- to four-unit principal residence: Calculate the net rental income without subtracting the proposed PITIA. Net rental income will be added to qualifying income. The PITIA will be included in the debt-to-income ratio.
Entry in the Loan Application
Rental income for the subject property must be entered as follows:
For a property already owned by the borrower: The borrower enters the property in Section 3 and the lender must calculate and enter the net rental income in Net Monthly Rental Income.
For a property the borrower is purchasing: The borrower enters Expected Monthly Rental Income in Section 4c and the lender must calculate and enter the net rental income in Expected Net Monthly Rental Income.
If income from an investment property is not included in the qualifying ratios, the lender must enter the entire proposed PITIA as a negative amount in Section 3 or 4c as applicable.
Note: Rental income from a one-unit principal residence with an accessory unit or from a two- to four- unit principal residence is an acceptable source of qualifying income on HomeReady loans. Enter Accessory Unit Income in Section 1e. Income from Other Sources in the online loan application.
Documentation of Rental Income
Refer to B3-3.1-08, Rental Income for the applicable documentation requirements. If the debt-to-income ratio includes the entire rental property payment and income from the property is not used in qualifying, rental income documentation is not required. However, documentation of gross monthly rent for the subject property is required for lender reporting purposes. See Reporting of Gross Monthly Rent in B3-3.1-08, Rental Income, for additional information.

What Are Liquid Financial Reserves?
Liquid ﬁnancial reserves are those liquid or near liquid assets that are available to a borrower after the mortgage closes. Liquid ﬁnancial reserves include cash and other assets that are easily converted to cash by the borrower by
Published February 5, 2025
389
drafting or withdrawing funds from an account,
selling an asset,
redeeming vested funds, or
obtaining a loan secured by assets from a fund administrator or an insurance company.
Reserves are measured by the number of months of the qualifying payment amount for the subject mortgage (based on PITIA) that a borrower could pay using their ﬁnancial assets. For monthly housing expense and qualifying payment requirements, see B3-6-03, Monthly Housing Expense for the Subject Property and B3-6-04, Qualifying Payment Requirements.
The deﬁnition of reserves applies to both manually underwritten mortgage loans and loan caseﬁles underwritten through DU. Funds to close are subtracted from available assets when considering suﬃcient assets for reserves.
Acceptable Sources of Reserves
Examples of liquid ﬁnancial assets that can be used for reserves include readily available funds in
checking or savings accounts;
investments in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, certiﬁcates of deposit, money market funds, and trust accounts;
the amount vested in a retirement savings account; and
the cash value of a vested life insurance policy.
Unacceptable Sources of Reserves
The following cannot be counted as part of the borrower’s reserves:
funds that have not been vested;
funds that cannot be withdrawn under circumstances other than the account owner’s retirement, employment termination, or death;
stock held in an unlisted corporation;
non-vested stock options and non-vested restricted stock;
personal unsecured loans;
rent-back credit;
interested party contributions (IPCs) (see B3-4.1-02, Interested Party Contributions (IPCs));
any amount of a lender contribution (see B3-4.3-06, Grants and Lender Contributions); and
cash proceeds from a cash-out reﬁnance transaction on the subject property.
Supplementing Borrower Funds
Published February 5, 2025

Funds received from acceptable sources may be used to supplement the borrower’s funds to satisfy any ﬁnancial reserve requirement.
Note: Eligible gift funds (but not gifts of equity) may be used to satisfy reserve requirements.

Minimum required reserves vary depending on
the transaction,
the occupancy status and amortization type of the subject property,
the number of units in the subject property, and
the number of other ﬁnanced properties the borrower currently owns.
Manually underwritten loans: The minimum required reserves are documented in the Eligibility Matrix.
DU loan caseﬁles: DU will determine the reserve requirements based on the following:
Two months' reserves for a second home transaction. Six months' reserves for the following:
a two- to four-unit principal residence transaction, an investment property transaction, and a cash-out reﬁnance transaction with a DTI ratio greater than 45%.
Additional reserves are required when a borrower has multiple ﬁnanced properties and the subject loan is secured by a second home or investment property. See Calculation of Reserves for Multiple Financed Properties below for additional details. Reserves equal to the balance of 30-day accounts (reduced by the cash back received on a reﬁnance transaction). Additional reserves may need to be veriﬁed based on DU's overall risk assessment.
Note: There is no minimum reserve requirement for one-unit principal residence transactions. High LTV reﬁnance loans are exempt from the minimum reserve requirements.
Calculation of Reserves for Multiple Financed Properties
If the borrower owns other ﬁnanced properties (determined in accordance with B2-2-03, Multiple Financed Properties for the Same Borrower), additional reserves must be calculated and documented for ﬁnanced properties other than the subject property and the borrower’s principal residence. The other ﬁnanced properties reserves amount must be determined by applying a speciﬁc percentage to the aggregate of the outstanding unpaid principal balance (UPB) for mortgages and HELOCs on these other ﬁnanced properties. The percentages are based on the number of ﬁnanced properties:
2% of the aggregate UPB if the borrower has one to four ﬁnanced properties,
4% of the aggregate UPB if the borrower has ﬁve to six ﬁnanced properties, or
6% of the aggregate UPB if the borrower has seven to ten ﬁnanced properties (DU only).
Published February 5, 2025
391
The aggregate UPB calculation does not include the mortgages and HELOCs that are on
the subject property,
the borrower’s principal residence,
properties that are sold or pending sale, and
accounts that will be paid by closing (or omitted in DU on the online loan application).
Simultaneous Second Home or Investment Property Transactions
If a lender is processing multiple second home or investment property applications simultaneously, the same assets may be used to satisfy the reserve requirements for both mortgage applications. Reserves are not cumulative for multiple applications.
Example: A lender is simultaneously processing two reﬁnance applications for two investment properties owned by the borrower. The application for property A requires reserves of $5,000. The application for property B requires reserves of $10,000. Because the reserves are covering the same properties, the lender does not have to verify $15,000 in reserves, but only those required per each application.

Introduction This topic contains information on interested party contributions, including:
Overview IPC Limits Lender Checklist for IPCs Lender Incentives for Borrowers
Published February 5, 2025
394
Overview
Interested party contributions (IPCs) are costs that are normally the responsibility of the property purchaser that are paid directly or indirectly by someone else who has a ﬁnancial interest in, or can inﬂuence the terms and the sale or transfer of, the subject property.
Interested parties to a transaction include, but are not limited to, the property seller, the builder/developer, the real estate agent or broker, or an aﬃliate who may beneﬁt from the sale of the property and/or the sale of the property at the highest price possible. A lender or employer is not considered an interested party to a sales transaction unless it is the property seller or is aﬃliated with the property seller or another interested party to the transaction. (For Fannie Mae's purposes, an aﬃliation exists when there is direct common ownership or control by the lender over the interested party or vice versa, or when there is direct common ownership or control by a third party over both the lender and the interested party. A typical ongoing business relationship — for example, the relationship between a builder and a lender that serves as its ﬁnancial institution — does not constitute an aﬃliation.)
IPCs are either ﬁnancing concessions or sales concessions. Fannie Mae considers the following to be IPCs:
funds that are paid directly from the interested party to the borrower;
funds that ﬂow from an interested party through a third-party organization, including nonproﬁt entities, to the borrower;
funds that ﬂow to the transaction on the borrower’s behalf from an interested party, including a third- party organization or nonproﬁt agency; and
funds that are donated to a third party, which then provides the money to pay some or all of the closing costs for a speciﬁc transaction.
A lender credit derived from premium pricing is not considered an IPC even if the lender is an interested party to the transaction.
See B3-4.1-03, Types of Interested Party Contributions (IPCs), for more information.
Fannie Mae does not permit IPCs to be used to make the borrower’s down payment, meet ﬁnancial reserve requirements, or meet minimum borrower contribution requirements.
Note: See B3-4.3-04, Personal Gifts for an exception when the seller of the subject property is also an acceptable donor.
IPC Limits
The table below provides IPC limits for conventional mortgages.
IPCs that exceed these limits are considered sales concessions. The property’s sales price must be adjusted downward to reﬂect the amount of contribution that exceeds the maximum, and the maximum LTV/CLTV ratios must be recalculated using the reduced sales price or appraised value.

Lender Checklist for IPCs
The lender must ensure that all of the following requirements for an IPC are satisﬁed.
✓
Lender Checklist for IPCs
Ensure that any and all IPCs have been identiﬁed and taken into consideration.
Provide the appraiser with all appropriate ﬁnancing data and IPCs for the subject property
granted by anyone associated with the transaction.
Ensure that the property value is adequately supported.
Ensure that the LTV and CLTV ratios, after any IPCs are taken into consideration, remain
within Fannie Mae’s eligibility limits for the particular product.
Ensure that mortgage insurance coverage, if applicable, has been obtained, based on the LTV
ratio after any IPC adjustments have been made.
Scrutinize all loan and sales contract documents, including but not limited to the sales
contract, the loan estimate, the loan application, the appraisal report, and the settlement
statement.
Ensure that all elements of the settlement statement were taken into consideration during the
underwriting process.

Lender Checklist for IPCs
Ensure that fees and expenses are consistent between all documents. Analyze any diﬀerences
and review any discrepancies.
Lender Incentives for Borrowers
Cash or Cash-like Incentives for all Transaction Types: The lender may provide the borrower with a cash or cash-like (e.g., a gift card) incentive that is not reﬂected on the settlement statement provided that
the amount of the incentive does not exceed $500, and
no repayment is required.
Because the lender is not typically a party to the sales transaction, these types of lender incentives are not considered IPCs and, as a result, are not included in the IPC limit calculation. Furthermore, these incentives are not considered cash out to the borrower and do not have to be included in the cash back to borrower at closing calculation.
Note: Documentation of compliance with this policy will not be required at the loan level. However, the lender must establish policies and/or procedures to ensure that the loans with these types of incentives that it delivers to Fannie Mae, whether or not the loans were originated by the lender, are in compliance with this policy.
Pay Down of Existing Mortgage Balance for Eligible Reﬁnance Transactions: For high LTV reﬁnance transactions, incentives to the borrower in the form of a payment to pay oﬀ a portion of the mortgage loan being reﬁnanced is not considered an IPC and, as a result, is not included in the IPC limit calculation. Furthermore, this incentive is not considered cash out to the borrower and it does not have to be included in the cash back to borrower at closing calculation.
See New Loan Requirements in B5-7-01, High LTV Reﬁnance Loan and Borrower Eligibility for additional requirements related to this policy for high LTV reﬁnance loans.

See B5-4.2-03, Loans Secured by HomePath Properties for an exception to this limit for principal residence transactions.

(06/05/2024)
Introduction This topic contains information on types of interested party contributions, including:
Undisclosed IPCs Down Payment Assistance Programs Financing Concessions Sales Concessions Interest Rate Buydowns Payment Abatements
Undisclosed IPCs
Mortgages with undisclosed IPCs are not eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae. Examples of these types of contributions include, but are not limited to, moving expenses, payment of various fees on the borrower’s behalf, “silent” second mortgages held by the property seller, and other contributions that are given to the borrower outside of closing and are not disclosed on the settlement statement.
Down Payment Assistance Programs
Funds that are donated to third parties which are then applied toward some or all of the borrower’s closing costs for a speciﬁc transaction are sometimes referred to as Down Payment Assistance Programs (DAPs). As long as the DAP allows such uses, these funds may also be used to pay for energy-related improvements that meet the requirements described in B5-3.3-01, HomeStyle Energy for Improvements on Existing Properties.
IPC funds that ﬂow through a DAP may be used for allowable closing costs, prepaids, and energy-related expenses in compliance with Fannie Mae’s IPC limits.
Published February 5, 2025

Financing Concessions
Financing concessions that are paid on the borrower’s behalf are subject to Fannie Mae’s IPC limits. Financing concessions are:
ﬁnancial contributions from interested parties that provide a beneﬁt to the borrower in the ﬁnancing transaction;
payments or credits related to acquiring the property; and
payments or credits for ﬁnancing terms, including prepaids.
Typical fees and/or closing costs paid by a seller in accordance with local custom, known as common and customary fees or costs, are not subject to Fannie Mae IPC limits. Payoﬀ of a PACE loan by a seller is not subject to Fannie Mae IPC limits because it is not a ﬁnancing concession. Financing concessions that exceed the limits listed below are considered sales concessions and are subject to Fannie Mae IPC limits.
Financing concessions typically include origination fees, discount points, commitment fees, appraisal costs, transfer taxes, stamps, attorneys’ fees, survey charges, title insurance premiums or charges, real estate tax service fees, and funds to subsidize a temporary or permanent interest rate buydown (if these fees are not considered common and customary fees or costs based on local custom, as described above). Financing concessions can also include prepaid items, such as:
interest charges (limited to no more than 30 days of interest);
real estate taxes covering any period after the settlement date (only if the taxes are being impounded by the servicer for future payment);
property insurance premiums (limited to no more than 14 months);
homeowners’ association (HOA) assessments covering any period after the settlement date (limited to no more than 12 months);
initial and/or renewal mortgage insurance premiums; and
escrow accruals required for renewal of borrower-purchased mortgage insurance coverage.
A legitimate pro-rated real estate tax credit in places where real estate taxes are paid in arrears is not considered a ﬁnancing concession and is not subject to Fannie Mae IPC limits.
Sales Concessions
Sales concessions are IPCs that take the form of non-realty items. They include cash, furniture, automobiles, decorator allowances, moving costs, and other giveaways, as well as ﬁnancing concessions that exceed Fannie Mae limits. Consequently, the value of sales concessions must be deducted from the sales price when calculating LTV and combined LTV ratios for underwriting and eligibility purposes.
Interest Rate Buydowns
If a temporary or permanent interest rate buydown is being oﬀered to the borrower, the cost of the subsidy to
Published February 5, 2025
399
fund that buydown must be included in the IPC calculation, if received from an interested party or a lender aﬃliated with an interested party.
The lender must determine if the cost of the subsidy meets allowable IPC limits. This can be accomplished by conﬁrming the current market interest rate—in other words, the rate that is oﬀered without the payment of any discount points—and the discount points being charged to obtain the interest rate being oﬀered with the buydown.
Note: Fees for standby commitments (also known as forward commitments) that a builder pays to a lender before entering into a sales contract with a borrower are not subject to Fannie Mae's IPC limits because they are not attributable to the speciﬁc loan transaction. A loan with a reduced interest rate due to a standby commitment must be delivered with SFC 887.
Payment Abatements
A payment abatement is considered to be a ﬁnancing concession since it is an incentive provided to the borrower by an interested party, in which the interested party provides funds to pay or reimburse a certain number of monthly payments on the borrower’s behalf. The monthly payments may cover, in whole or in part, principal, interest, taxes, insurance and other assessments (PITIA). These funds are provided to the lender or a third party to be distributed over the term of the abatement period or credited against the borrower's future obligations.
Loans with payment abatements of any type are not eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae regardless of whether they are disclosed on the settlement statement. This prohibition applies to transactions in which an interested party is directly funding the abatement and/or if the funding for the abatement is ﬂowing through another entity such, as a nonproﬁt down payment assistance program.
Note: The payment of HOA fees is not considered an abatement unless the payment of the fee extends for more than 12 months. The payment of HOA fees for 12 months or less is considered an interested party contribution.

Virtual Currency
Virtual Currency
Virtual currency that has been exchanged into U.S. dollars is acceptable for the down payment, closing costs, and ﬁnancial reserves provided the following requirements are met:
there is documented evidence that the virtual currency has been exchanged into U.S. dollars and is held in a U.S. or state regulated ﬁnancial institution, and the funds are veriﬁed in U.S. dollars prior to the loan closing.
A large deposit may be from virtual currency that was exchanged into U.S. dollars. The lender must obtain suﬃcient documentation to verify the funds originated from the borrower's virtual currency account.
Virtual currency may not be used for the deposit on the sales contract (earnest money) for the purchase of the subject property.

Introduction This topic contains information on verifying deposits and assets, including:
Veriﬁcation of Deposits and Assets Asset Documentation Provided by a Third-Party Asset Veriﬁcation Vendor Blanket Authorization Form
Veriﬁcation of Deposits and Assets
The lender can use any of the following types of documentation to verify that a borrower has suﬃcient funds for closing, down payment, and/or ﬁnancial reserves:
Request for Veriﬁcation of Deposit (Form 1006). The information must be requested directly from the depository institution, and the complete, signed, and dated document must be sent directly from the depository institution.
Copies of bank statements or investment portfolio statements. All statements must:
clearly identify the ﬁnancial institution,
clearly identify the borrower as the account holder,
include at least the last four digits of the account number,
include the time period covered by the statement,
include all deposits and withdrawal transactions (for depository accounts),
include all purchase and sale transactions (for ﬁnancial portfolio accounts), and
include the ending account balance.
If the lender is the holder of the borrower's account, the lender may produce a printout or other alternative veriﬁcation of the asset(s) directly from its system. The printout or alternative veriﬁcation is acceptable as long as all required data (above) is supplied and documented.
Copies of retirement account statements. They must be the most recent statements, and they must identify the borrower’s vested amount and the terms. (See B3-4.3-03, Retirement Accounts, for additional information.)
The number of required bank or investment portfolio statements varies per transaction type as shown in the following table.
Published February 5, 2025
402
Documentation Requirements
The statements must cover the most recent full two-month period of account
Purchase transactions
activity (60 days, or, if account information is reported on a quarterly basis, the
most recent quarter).
The statements must cover the most recent full one-month period of account
Reﬁnance transactions
activity (30 days, or, if account information is reported on a quarterly basis, the
most recent quarter).
If the latest bank statement is more than 45 days earlier than the date of the loan application, the lender should ask the borrower to provide a more recent, supplemental, bank-generated form that shows at least the last four digits of the account number, balance, and date. The statements may be computer-generated forms, including online account or portfolio statements downloaded by the borrower from the Internet.
Documents that are faxed to the lender or downloaded from the Internet must clearly identify the name of the depository or investment institution and the source of information—for example, by including that information in the Internet or fax banner at the top of the document.
If necessary, the lender must supplement these veriﬁcations by obtaining any missing information from the borrower or the depository institution.
See B3-4.4-02, Requirements for Certain Assets in DU, for additional information about documentation of assets for DU loan caseﬁles.
In addition, loans with assets validated by DU must comply with all requirements pertaining to the DU validation service. Compliance with the DU messages satisﬁes the requirement for documenting assets. This documentation may diﬀer from the requirements described above. See B3-2-02, DU Validation Service , for additional information.
Asset Documentation Provided by a Third-Party Asset Veriﬁcation Vendor
Direct veriﬁcation by a third-party asset veriﬁcation vendor. These veriﬁcations are acceptable as long as:
the borrower provided proper authorizations for the lender to use the veriﬁcation method,
the veriﬁed information provided must conform with the information that would be provided on Form 1006 or on bank statements,
the date of the completed veriﬁcation is in compliance with B1-1-03, Allowable Age of Credit Documents and Federal Income Tax Returns,
the lender has determined that the vendor maintains reasonable practices that ensure reliable and authorized veriﬁcations of deposit and asset information (see A4-1-01, Maintaining Seller/Servicer Eligibility), and
the lender understands it will be held accountable for the integrity of the information obtained from this source.
Published February 5, 2025

Blanket Authorization Form
Rather than having the applicant sign multiple forms, the lender may have the applicant sign an authorization form which gives the lender blanket authorization to request the information it needs to evaluate the applicant’s creditworthiness. (See B1-1-02, Blanket Authorization Form.) When the lender uses this type of blanket authorization, it must attach a copy of the authorization form to each Form 1006 it sends to the depository institutions in which the applicant has accounts.

Depository Accounts
Funds held in a checking, savings, money market, certiﬁcate of deposit, or other depository accounts may be used for the down payment, closing costs, and ﬁnancial reserves. The funds must be veriﬁed as described in B3-4.2-01, Veriﬁcation of Deposits and Assets. Unveriﬁed funds are not acceptable for the down payment, closing costs, or ﬁnancial reserves.
The lender must investigate any indications of borrowed funds. These must be identiﬁed diﬀerently based upon how the asset account was veriﬁed.
Published February 5, 2025
404
Business Assets
Business assets may be an acceptable source of funds for the down payment, closing costs, and ﬁnancial reserves. The borrower must be listed as an owner of the account and the account must be veriﬁed in accordance with B3-4.2-01, Veriﬁcation of Deposits and Assets. If the borrower is also using self-employment income from this business to qualify, see Section B3–3.2, Self-Employment Income, for additional information on the analysis of a self-employed borrower.
Evaluating Large Deposits
A large deposit is deﬁned as a single deposit that exceeds 50% of the total monthly qualifying income for the loan. When bank statements (typically covering the most recent two months) are used, the lender must evaluate large deposits. See B3-4.1-04, Virtual Currency for additional information when a large deposit may be from virtual currency that was exchanged into U.S. dollars. Requirements for evaluating large deposits vary based on the transaction type, as shown in the table below.

Published February 5, 2025
Evaluation Requirements
If funds from a large deposit are needed to complete the purchase
transaction (that is, are used for the down payment, closing costs, or
ﬁnancial reserves), the lender must document that those funds are from an
acceptable source. Occasionally, a borrower may not have all of the
documentation required to conﬁrm the source of a deposit. In those
instances, the lender must use reasonable judgment based on the available
documentation as well as the borrower’s debt-to-income ratio and overall
income and credit proﬁle. Examples of acceptable documentation include
the borrower’s written explanation, proof of ownership of an asset that was
sold, or a copy of a wedding invitation to support receipt of gift funds. The
lender must place in the loan ﬁle written documentation of the rationale for
using the funds.
Veriﬁed funds must be reduced by the amount (or portion) of the
undocumented large deposit (as deﬁned above), and the lender must
conﬁrm that the remaining funds are suﬃcient for the down payment,
closing costs, and ﬁnancial reserves. When the lender uses a reduced asset
amount, net of the unsourced amount of a large deposit, that reduced
amount must be used for underwriting purposes (whether the loan is
underwritten manually or through DU).
Note: When a deposit has both sourced and unsourced portions, only the
unsourced portion must be used to calculate whether or not it must be
considered a large deposit.
Examples
Scenario 1: Borrower has monthly income of $4,000 and an account at
ABC Bank with a balance of $20,000. A deposit of $3,000 is identiﬁed, but
$2,500 of that deposit is documented as coming from the borrower's federal
income tax refund. Only the unsourced $500 [the deposit of $3,000 minus
the documented $2,500] must be considered in calculating whether it meets
the large deposit deﬁnition. The unsourced $500 is 12.5% of the borrower’s
$4,000 monthly income, falling short of the 50% deﬁnition of a large deposit.
Therefore, it is not considered a large deposit and the entire $20,000
balance in the ABC Bank account can be used for underwriting purposes.
Scenario 2: Using the same borrower example, a deposit of $3,000 is
identiﬁed, but only $500 is documented as coming from the borrower’s
federal income tax refund, leaving $2,500 unsourced. In this instance, the
unsourced $2,500 is 63% of the borrower’s $4,000 monthly income, which
does meet the deﬁnition of a large deposit. Therefore, the unsourced $2,500
must be subtracted from the account balance of $20,000 and only the
remaining $17,500 may be used for underwriting purposes.
406
Note: If the source of a large deposit is readily identiﬁable on the account statement(s), such as a direct deposit from an employer (payroll), the Social Security Administration, or IRS or state income tax refund, or a transfer of funds between veriﬁed accounts, and the source of the deposit is printed on the statement, the lender does not need to obtain further explanation or documentation. However, if the source of the deposit is printed on the statement, but the lender still has questions as to whether the funds may have been borrowed, the lender should obtain additional documentation.
The DU validation service automates the assessment of large deposits. When assets are validated, DU issues a message indicating which large deposits require documentation. Compliance with the DU messages satisﬁes the requirement for documenting large deposits. See B3-2-02, DU Validation Service
Request for Veriﬁcation of Deposit
When a Veriﬁcation of Deposit (Form 1006) (VOD) is used and depository activity is not included, the lender must verify the source of funds for
accounts opened within the last 90 days of the application date, and
account balances that are considerably greater than the average balance reﬂected on the VOD.

Individual Development Accounts
Some nonproﬁt agencies will match the funds a borrower regularly deposits into a savings account that has been designated as an account that is used solely for the accumulation of funds to purchase a home. Such accounts are referred to as individual development accounts, or IDAs.
Nonproﬁt agencies that oﬀer IDA programs have options with respect to accumulating and holding the matching funds, which include:
the use of a parallel “savings” account that is separate from the homebuyer’s savings account;
separately designated matching funds within a single agency account via accounting processes to allocate matching funds to a particular homebuyer; and
the use of a trustee account that contains both the homebuyer’s funds and the agency’s matching funds.
When a homebuyer reaches the target amount and is ready to complete the home purchase, the funds are disbursed from the nonproﬁt agency account to the closing agent via a single check or multiple checks.
If the agency’s matching funds are held in an account that is separate from the homebuyer’s account, the matching funds need not be commingled with the homebuyer’s funds prior to disbursement to the closing agent. It is acceptable to allow the separate disbursement of funds from the agency and from the homebuyer, as long as the terms of the IDA program are met.
Funds that the borrower deposited into an IDA may be used for either closing costs or the down payment.
Use of IDA Funds to Meet Borrower Minimum Contribution Requirements
Funds that the borrower deposited into an IDA may be used for either the closing costs or the down payment. Depending on the repayment terms of the IDA program, the borrower may or may not be required to meet the minimum down payment requirements from their own funds, as outlined below:

from exercise of an option and the sale of the optioned stock.
Note: Non-vested stock options are not an acceptable source of funds for
the down payment, closing costs, or reserves and should not be entered on
the loan application.
Government bonds
The value of government bonds must be based on their purchase price
unless the redemption value can be documented.
When used for the down payment or closing costs, if the value of the asset (as determined above) is at least 20% more than the amount of funds needed for the down payment and closing costs, no documentation of the borrower’s actual receipt of funds realized from the sale or liquidation is required. Otherwise, evidence of the borrower’s actual receipt of funds realized from the sale or liquidation must be documented.
When used for reserves, 100% of the value of the assets (as determined above) may be considered, and liquidation is not required.

Documentation Requirements
Gifts must be evidenced by a letter signed by the donor, called a gift letter. When the gift is sourced by a trust established by an acceptable donor or an estate of an acceptable donor, the gift letter must be signed by the donor and list the name of the trust or the estate account.
The gift letter must:
specify the actual or the maximum dollar amount of the gift;
include the donor’s statement that no repayment is expected; and
indicate the donor’s name, address, telephone number, and relationship to the borrower.
Published February 5, 2025

Note: If the actual amount of the gift received is diﬀerent than the amount used to underwrite the loan caseﬁle in DU, the lender may need to resubmit the loan caseﬁle to DU in accordance with B3-2-10, Accuracy of DU Data, DU Tolerances, and Errors in the Credit Report. For manually underwritten loans, the lender must verify the borrower has suﬃcient funds for closing, down payment and/or ﬁnancial reserves.
When a gift from an acceptable donor is being pooled with the borrower’s funds to make up the required minimum cash down payment, the following items must also be included:
A certiﬁcation from the donor stating that they have lived with the borrower for the past 12 months and will continue to do so in the new residence.
Documents that demonstrate a history of borrower and donor shared residency. The donor’s address must be the same as the borrower’s address. Examples include but are not limited to a copy of a driver’s license, a bill, or a bank statement.
Verifying Donor Availability of Funds and Transfer of Gift Funds
The lender must verify that suﬃcient funds to cover the gift are either in the donor’s account (such as a checking, savings or investment account, or trust or estate account owned by the donor) or have been transferred to the borrower’s account. Acceptable documentation includes the following:
a copy of the donor’s check and the borrower’s deposit slip,
a copy of the donor’s withdrawal slip and the borrower’s deposit slip,
evidence of the electronic transfer of funds from the donor's account to the borrower's account or to the closing agent;
a copy of the donor’s check to the closing agent, or
a settlement statement showing receipt of the donor’s check.
When the funds are not transferred prior to settlement, the lender must document that the donor gave the closing agent the gift funds in the form of an electronic transfer, certiﬁed check, a cashier’s check, or other oﬃcial check.
1
If the borrower receives a gift from an acceptable donor who has lived with the borrower for the last 12 months, the gift is considered the borrower’s own funds and may be used to satisfy the minimum borrower contribution requirement as long as both individuals will use the home being purchased as their principal residence.

Lender-funded Grants
A lender-funded grant is subject to the requirements described in this topic, but must also meet the requirements in the following table.
✓
Additional Requirements for Lender-funded Grants
The loan must be a HomeReady loan used for a purchase transaction. See Chapter B5-6,
HomeReady Mortgage for additional information.
One-unit principal residences: The borrower(s) must make a 3% contribution from their own
funds, other eligible sources of funds as described in Chapter B3-4, Asset Assessment, or
through a Community Seconds loan.
Two- to four-unit principal residences with LTV, CLTV, or HCLTV ratios 80% or less: The
borrower(s) must make a 3% contribution from their own funds, other eligible sources of funds
as described in Chapter B3-4, Asset Assessment, or through a Community Seconds loan.
Two- to four-unit principal residences with LTV, CLTV, or HCLTV ratios greater than 80%: The
borrower(s) must make a 5% minimum contribution from their own funds.
The lender must have a documented program that provides grants for low- to moderate-income
borrowers, community development, equitable housing initiatives, or similar initiatives.
Note: When a lender is only providing closing cost assistance, the Lender Contributions policy may be applied instead of the Lender-funded Grants policy.
Lender Contributions
The lender may provide the borrower with a contribution to fund borrower-paid closing costs and prepaid fees in the following cases:
Published February 5, 2025
420
The lender credit is derived from premium pricing, as described in Premium Pricing in B2-1.5-02, Loan Eligibility.
The lender credit is sourced directly from lender funds with no expectation for repayment or ﬁnancial obligation apart from the subject mortgage. Funds passed to the lender from a third party, for the purpose of providing a lender credit, are not eligible as a lender contribution.
The amount of the lender contribution should not exceed the amount of borrower-paid closing costs and prepaid fees and may not be used to fund any portion of the down payment or ﬁnancial reserve requirements. Lender contributions are not considered grants.
When the lender is an interested party to a purchase transaction, any amount of a lender contribution not derived from premium pricing, must be considered as an IPC when calculating the maximum IPC limit for eligibility purposes.
Any excess lender credit required to be returned to the borrower in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements is considered an overpayment of fees and charges and may be applied as a principal curtailment or returned in cash to the borrower. See B2-1.3-01, Purchase Transactions and B2-1.3-02, Limited Cash-Out Reﬁnance Transactions for treatment of the overpayment of fees and charges.
Lenders may also provide borrowers with cash or cash-like incentives that do not need to be reﬂected on the settlement statement. See B3-4.1-02, Interested Party Contributions (IPCs) for additional information.
Note: If a lender is required to provide down payment assistance to satisfy a legal settlement or judgement, enforcement action or other regulatory action, Fannie Mae will consider purchasing those loans on a negotiated basis. Lenders may contact their Fannie Mae customer account team for more information.

Yes
Sales Price – (Sales Costs + All Liens) = Estimated Proceeds
90% of Listing Price – All Liens = Estimated Proceeds
No
Note: The 10% adjustment factor that is applied to the listing price must be
changed depending on market conditions.
Sales Proceeds Needed for Down Payment and Closing Costs
If the proceeds from the sale of a currently owned home are needed for the down payment and closing costs on the new house, the lender must verify the source of funds by obtaining a copy of the settlement statement on the existing home before, or simultaneously with, the settlement on the new home, showing suﬃcient net cash proceeds to consummate the purchase of the new home.
Like-Kind Exchanges
Assets for the down payment from a “like-kind exchange,” also known as a 1031 exchange, are eligible if properly documented and in compliance with Internal Revenue Code Section 1031.
Employee Relocation
When the borrower’s employer assumes responsibility for paying oﬀ the existing mortgage in connection with a relocation plan, the lender must obtain a copy of the executed buy-out agreement to document the source of funds. A photocopy of a sales contract or a listing agreement is not considered an acceptable source of veriﬁcation of proceeds from the sale.

Introduction This topic contains information on trade equity, including:
Trade Equity Calculating the Equity Contribution Documentation Requirements
Trade Equity
Trade equity is an acceptable source of funds to supplement the borrower’s minimum borrower contribution provided the following requirements are met:
The seller’s equity contribution for the traded property must be a true-value consideration supported by a current appraisal.
The borrower must make the minimum required contribution from their own funds unless:
the LTV or CLTV ratio is less than or equal to 80%; or
the borrower is purchasing a one-unit principal residence and meets the requirements to use gifts, donated grant funds, or funds received from an employer to pay for some or all of the borrower's minimum contribution. See B3-4.3-04, Personal Gifts; B3-4.3-06, Grants and Lender Contributions; and B3-4.3-08, Employer Assistance, for additional information.
These requirements apply to all transactions that involve property trades, including those that are evidenced by two separate contracts that have the buyer and the seller on one contract reversing roles on the second contract.
Note: Trade equity is entered in the loan application as a credit to the transaction, which will reduce the borrower’s required funds to close.
Calculating the Equity Contribution
The equity contribution is determined by subtracting the outstanding mortgage balance of the property being traded, plus any transfer costs, from the lesser of either the property’s appraised value or the trade-in value agreed to by both parties.
For trade equity requirements for manufactured housing, see Section B5–2–03, Manufactured Housing Underwriting Requirements.
Documentation Requirements
For real property, the transfer deed must be recorded.

Rent credit with an option to purchase is the portion of rental payments (also referred to as lease payments) paid by the borrower that can be credited towards the down payment or minimum borrower contribution under a documented rental or purchase agreement. Borrowers are not required to make a minimum borrower contribution from their own funds for the rental payments to be credited toward the down payment. The rent credit is not considered an interested party contribution.
The rent credit from the seller for the down payment is determined by calculating the diﬀerence between the market rent and the actual rent paid by the borrower. The market rent is determined by the appraiser in the appraisal for the subject property and the credit may be no more than the diﬀerence between the market rent and the actual rent paid.
Documentation Requirements
The lender must obtain the following documentation:
A copy of the rental/lease with an option to purchase agreement that evidences the following:
Published February 5, 2025
428
an original term of at least 12 months, the total number of months of the agreement, the monthly rental amount, and the amount of the monthly rent credit.
Copies of the borrower's canceled checks, bank statements, money order receipts or other reasonable methods evidencing the rental payments over the term of the agreement. The documentation must clearly indicate the payee and the amount being paid. The appraisal of the subject property reﬂecting the market rent amount.
Rent-Back Credit
A rent-back credit is an amount paid by the property seller to the borrower in exchange for allowing the seller to stay in the home for a speciﬁed period of time after closing. While rent-back credit to the borrower paid by the seller is permissible as part of the sale; it cannot be used as an eligible source of funds for closing costs, down payment, or reserves when qualifying the borrower.
A rent-back credit may appear on the Closing Disclosure as a credit to the borrower. In all cases, the lender must underwrite the loan without any consideration of the rent-back credit (e.g., it must not be entered in the DU loan application data) and must document that the borrower has suﬃcient funds for the transaction from eligible sources.
Note: For loans secured by the borrower's principal residence, the borrower must continue to meet any occupancy requirements as outlined in the security instrument.

Reducing the Asset by the Amount Borrowed Documentation Requirements
Borrowed Funds Secured by an Asset
Borrowed funds secured by an asset are an acceptable source of funds for the down payment, closing costs, and reserves, since borrowed funds secured by an asset represent a return of equity.
Assets that may be used to secure funds include automobiles, artwork, collectibles, real estate, or ﬁnancial assets, such as savings accounts, certiﬁcates of deposit, stocks, bonds, and 401(k) accounts.
Secured Loans as Debt
When qualifying the borrower, the lender must consider monthly payments for secured loans as a debt.
If a secured loan does not require monthly payments, the lender must calculate an equivalent amount and consider that amount as a recurring debt.
When loans are secured by the borrower’s ﬁnancial assets, monthly payments for the loan do not have to be considered as long-term debt.
Reducing the Asset by the Amount Borrowed
If the borrower uses the same ﬁnancial asset as part of their ﬁnancial reserves, the lender must reduce the value of the asset by the amount of proceeds and related fees for the secured loan.
Documentation Requirements
The lender must document the following:
the terms of the secured loan,
evidence that the party providing the secured loan is not a party to the sale, and
evidence that the funds have been transferred to the borrower.

B3-4.3-16, Credit Card Financing and Reward Points (08/04/2021)
Introduction This topic contains information on the following:
Credit Card Financing Credit Card Reward Points
Credit Card Financing
Fannie Mae permits certain costs that must be paid early in the application process, such as lock-in fees, origination fees, commitment fees, credit report fees, and appraisal fees, to be charged to the borrower’s credit card because these fees do not represent extraordinary amounts and the credit card debt is considered in the borrower’s total monthly debt-to-income ratio. Borrowers are not required to pay oﬀ these credit card changes before closing. Under no circumstances may credit card ﬁnancing be used for the down payment.
Lenders may allow credit card ﬁnancing for the payment of common and customary fees paid outside of closing up to a maximum of 2% of the loan amount if the lender:
conﬁrms that the borrower has suﬃcient liquid funds (ﬁnancial reserves) to cover these charges (in addition to funds needed for other closing costs and the down payment that they will be paying); or
recalculates the credit card payment, per B3-6-05, Monthly Debt Obligations, to account for the new charges and includes the updated payment in the qualifying ratio calculation.
For DU, lenders must apply this policy manually. The fees charged to the borrower’s credit card must be included as a closing cost in the loan application, and removed from any Borrower Paid Fees entered as an other credit for the fees paid outside of closing. Alternatively, the monthly credit card payment in the liabilities section of the loan application must be increased to include the charges if not reﬂected in the credit report.
Credit Card Reward Points
Fannie Mae permits credit card reward points as acceptable funds for use towards closing costs, down payment and ﬁnancial reserves, provided the reward points are converted to cash prior to the closing of the loan. The following requirements apply:
If the credit card reward points are converted to cash and deposited into the borrower’s depository account (for example, checking or savings), no additional documentation is required unless the deposit is considered a large deposit. In this event, the lender must follow the requirements in Evaluating Large Deposits in B3-4.2-02, Depository Accounts .
If the credit card reward points are converted to cash, but not deposited into a borrower’s depository account, the lender must provide evidence the reward points were
available to the borrower prior to the conversion, including veriﬁcation of the cash value (for example, credit card reward statement prior to conversion); and
converted to cash prior to the closing of the loan.
Published February 5, 2025
432
For DU loan caseﬁles, if the reward points are not already converted to cash and deposited into a depository account, lenders must enter the cash value of the reward points as an Asset with an Account Type of "Other" and a description of "Liquid Asset". See B3-4.4-02, Requirements for Certain Assets in DU for more information.

Sale of Personal Assets Documentation Requirements
Sale of Personal Assets
Proceeds from the sale of personal assets are an acceptable source of funds for the down payment, closing costs, and reserves provided the individual purchasing the asset is not a party to the property sale transaction or the mortgage ﬁnancing transaction.
Documentation Requirements
The lender must document the following:
The borrower’s ownership of the asset for all asset types that are titled assets, for example automobile title.
The value of the asset, as determined by an independent and reputable source, if the proceeds represent more than 50% of the total monthly income used in qualifying. The lender must use the lesser of the estimated value (as determined by the independent source) or actual sales price when determining the amount of funds for the transaction. For example, a borrower plans to sell their vehicle. The value as determined by an independent source is $10,000; the sales price of the vehicle is $12,000. $10,000 can be added to the borrower’s available funds even if the sale has already occured.
The transfer of ownership of the asset, as documented by either a bill of sale or a statement from the purchaser.
The borrower’s receipt of the sale proceeds from documents such as deposit slips, bank statements, copies of the purchaser’s canceled check or an equivalent payment source.

Cash Value of Life Insurance and Debt-to-Income Ratios Documenting Borrower Receipt of Funds
Cash Value of Life Insurance and Debt-to-Income Ratios
Net proceeds from a loan against the cash value or from the surrender of a life insurance policy are an acceptable source of funds for the down payment, closing costs, and reserves.
The lender must assess repayment or additional obligation considerations to determine the impact on borrower qualiﬁcation or reserves.
If penalties for failure to repay the loan are limited to the surrender of the policy, payments on a loan secured by the cash value of a borrower’s life insurance policy do not have to be considered in the total debt-to-income ratio.
If additional obligations are indicated, the obligation amount must be factored into the total debt-to-income ratio, or subtracted from the borrower’s ﬁnancial reserves.
Documenting Borrower Receipt of Funds
If the funds are needed for the down payment or closing costs, lenders must document the borrower’s receipt of the funds from the insurance company by obtaining either a copy of the check from the insurer or a copy of the payout statement issued by the insurer. If the cash-value of the life insurance is being used for reserves, the cash-value must be documented but does not need to be liquidated and received by the borrower.

Published February 5, 2025
435
Anticipated Savings
The lender may preliminarily qualify a borrower on the basis that anticipated savings will be suﬃcient to meet the funds needed for closing. The lender must verify that savings are actually accumulated by the borrower before loan closing.
The estimate for a borrower’s anticipated savings must be realistically developed. To calculate potential saved funds, the lender should reduce the borrower’s expected after-tax income for the expected savings period by existing housing expenses, monthly debt expenses based on data from the credit report, and expected living expenses, such as food, transportation, etc.
Cash-on-Hand
Cash-on-hand is not an acceptable source of funds for the down payment or closing costs.
For HomeReady mortgages, cash-on-hand may be considered an acceptable source of funds for the down payment and closing cost. See Chapter B5–6, HomeReady Mortgage.

Introduction This topic contains information on asset veriﬁcation for loans underwritten with DU, including:
Liquid Assets Non-Liquid Assets Reserve Requirements Asset Values in the DU Underwriting Findings Report Non-Occupant Borrower Asset Requirements
Liquid Assets
DU analyzes the value of liquid assets entered in the loan application in its risk assessment. Assets may be excluded from the loan application if the borrower can qualify without them.
Published February 5, 2025
437
DU considers the following assets liquid assets: Bonds, Bridge Loan Proceeds, Cash-on-Hand (for certain HomeReady loans only), Cash Value of Life Insurance, Certiﬁcate of Deposit, Checking, Gift (not deposited), Gift of Equity, Grant (not deposited), Individual Development Account, Money Market, Mutual Fund, Net Equity, Other Liquid Asset, Proceeds from Real Estate Property to be sold on or before closing, Proceeds from Sale of Non-Real Estate Asset, Retirement, Savings, Secured Borrowed Funds, Stocks, Stock Options (vested), and Trust Account.
Note: Some of these asset types may not be available in the lender’s loan origination system.
Non-Liquid Assets
DU does not consider the amount of non-liquid assets. Non-liquid assets do not have to be veriﬁed, and will not be identiﬁed in a veriﬁcation message.
DU considers the following assets non-liquid assets: Cash Deposit on Sales, Net Worth of Business, Other Non- Liquid Asset, and Unsecured Borrowed Funds.
Note: Some of these asset types may not be available in the lender’s loan origination system.
Reserve Requirements
For loan caseﬁles underwritten with DU, DU will determine the reserve requirements based on the overall risk assessment of the loan caseﬁle and the minimum reserves that may be required for the transaction. Reserves may be considered a compensating factor in DU's risk analysis, and may serve to improve the underwriting recommendation.
Refer to the following topics for additional requirements related to minimum reserves:
B2-2-03, Multiple Financed Properties for the Same Borrower
B3-4.1-01, Minimum Reserve Requirements
Asset Values in the DU Underwriting Findings Report
The DU Underwriting Findings report will identify the following values:
Total Available Assets: the total of all borrower(s)’ liquid assets entered into DU;
Funds Required to Close: includes the cash needed to complete the transaction plus any debts marked paid by closing on purchase or limited cash-out reﬁnance transactions, other than subject property mortgage(s);
Reserves Required to be Veriﬁed: the amount of reserves that must be veriﬁed;
Total Funds to be Veriﬁed: the sum of Funds Required to Close and Reserves Required to be Veriﬁed; and
Excess Available Assets, not required to be veriﬁed by DU: liquid assets that DU is not requiring the lender to verify.
Published February 5, 2025
438
The Excess Available Assets, not required to be veriﬁed by DU (Excess Available Assets) amount represents the amount of assets remaining after subtracting the Total Funds to be Veriﬁed from the Total Available Assets. Excess Available Assets do not generally need to be veriﬁed.
Non-Occupant Borrower Asset Requirements
Assets that are owned by a non-occupant borrower can be included in the 5% minimum borrower contribution requirement (when applicable), and those funds must be entered in the loan application. Total liquid assets for the occupying borrower and non-occupant borrower are included in DU’s calculation of total available assets.

Asset Veriﬁcation Documentation
When DU requires assets to be veriﬁed, DU will indicate the minimum veriﬁcation documentation requirements necessary for the lender to process the loan application. This level of documentation may not be adequate for every borrower and every situation. The lender must determine whether additional documentation is warranted.
Published February 5, 2025
439
DU will not require documentation of assets for reﬁnance transactions when the total funds to be veriﬁed are $500 or less.
Depository Assets
For depository assets (checking and savings accounts, money market funds, and certiﬁcates of deposit), DU will require the following:
two consecutive monthly bank statements (60 days of account activity) for all purchase transactions, or one monthly statement (30 days of account activity) for all limited cash-out and cash-out reﬁnance transactions.
Monthly bank statements must be dated within 45 days of the initial loan application date.
Quarterly bank statements must be dated within 90 days of the initial loan application date, and the lender must conﬁrm that the funds in the account have not been transferred to another asset account that is veriﬁed with more current documentation.
A Veriﬁcation of Deposit (Form 1006) can be obtained in place of bank statements.
When DU validates assets, DU issues a message indicating the acceptable documentation. Compliance with the DU message satisﬁes the requirement for documenting assets. This documentation may diﬀer from the requirements described above. See B3-2-02, DU Validation Service.
Bridge Loan
Enter the amount of a bridge (or swing) loan in the asset section 2a of the loan application. Do not include the amount of the bridge loan in any other liquid asset. (For example, do not enter the amount of the loan both as a bridge loan and in a checking account, even if the loan funds have been deposited.)
Bridge loans should also be considered in the net equity calculation for properties that are pending sale. (In other words, the amount of the bridge loan should be subtracted from the net proceeds to avoid counting this asset twice.)
See B3-4.3-14, Bridge/Swing Loans for additional information.
Note: It may also be necessary to enter the bridge loan and corresponding monthly payment as a recurring liability in the liabilities section of the loan application. See the bridge loan liability discussion in B3-6-05, Monthly Debt Obligations.
Cash Deposit on Sales Contract (Earnest Money)
Earnest money is entered in Section 2b in the loan application. It is treated as a credit to the transaction and will reduce the borrower’s required funds to close as reﬂected in Section L4. The earnest money check is assumed to have cleared the borrower’s bank account and must not be reﬂected in the balance of an asset account.
Published February 5, 2025
440
See B3-4.3-09, Earnest Money Deposit, for documentation requirements.
Gifts and Grants
Gifts or donations from entities (grants) are permitted and documented in accordance with B3-4.3-04, Personal Gifts, and B3-4.3-06, Grants and Lender Contributions.
Gifts and grants are entered in Section 4d of the loan application and identiﬁed as being deposited or not deposited. Gifts and grants that are deposited have been received by the borrower and the value should be included in another asset account. The amount of the gift or grant is not included in available funds.
Gifts and grants that are not deposited are not included in another asset account. The amount of the gift is included in available funds.
Gifts of Equity
Enter a gift of equity in Section 4d of the loan application.
A gift of equity must meet the gift of equity requirements deﬁned in B3-4.3-05, Gifts of Equity.
Net Equity from Properties Pending Sale
See B3-4.3-10, Anticipated Sales Proceeds, for additional information.
The lender must calculate the net equity outside of DU for a property marked Pending Sale in Section 3 of the loan application. The amount is entered in the asset section (2b) using the asset type Proceeds from Real Estate Property to be Sold on or Before Closing.
If a bridge loan is obtained, the amount of the bridge loan is entered as an asset and must be subtracted from net equity before entry in the loan application.
When the net equity is positive, DU will add the amount to the funds available for closing. When the net equity is negative, DU will subtract the amount from the funds available for closing.
Proceeds from Sold Properties
Proceeds from properties that have already been sold must be included in a depository account, such as a checking or savings account.
Other Liquid Assets
Enter the value of personal assets that will be converted to a liquid asset (or sold) prior to closing in Section 2b using the asset type Proceeds from Sale of Non-Real Estate Asset. (See B3-4.3-18, Sale of Personal Assets, for additional information.) Life insurance that will be used for the transaction is entered in Section 2a using the
Published February 5, 2025
441
account type Cash Value of Life Insurance. An Other Asset (liquid) may be entered for other types of assets that will be used for the transaction, such as pending tax refunds that will be received prior to closing.
A veriﬁcation message will require evidence of the value of the asset and conﬁrmation that the asset was converted to cash.
Secured Borrowed Funds
Borrowers can borrow against an asset they own, such as a 401(k) account or real estate, according to the requirements of B3-6-05, Monthly Debt Obligations. The amount of the secured loan should be entered in Section 2b using the asset type Secured Borrowed Funds. The secured loan amount should be subtracted from the market value of the actual asset, and the net asset value should be entered. For example, if the borrower has a vested value, less taxes and penalties, of $30,000 in a 401(k) account and borrows $10,000 against the 401(k), enter $10,000 as secured borrowed funds and enter $20,000 as retirement funds.
A loan that is secured against a liquid asset owned by the borrower (such as a 401(k) or mutual fund) does not have to be entered as a liability in the loan application if the appropriate documentation is provided.
Loans that are secured against real estate, or any other non-liquid asset, must be entered as the applicable liability (for example, as a mortgage).

Introduction This topic describes Fannie Mae’s requirements for borrower credit scores, including:
Credit Score Versions Minimum Credit Score Requirements Exceptions to the Minimum Credit Score Requirement DU Credit Score Requirements Delivery of Credit Scores Loan-Level Price Adjustments Based on Credit Score
Credit Score Versions
Credit scores are required for most loans purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae. The classic FICO credit score is produced from software developed by Fair Isaac Corporation and is available from the three major credit repositories. Fannie Mae requires the following versions of the classic FICO score for both DU and manually underwritten mortgage loans:
Equifax Beacon® 5.0;
Experian®/Fair Isaac Risk Model V2SM; and
TransUnion FICO® Risk Score, Classic 04.
The lender must request these FICO credit scores for each borrower from each of the three major credit repositories when they order the three in-ﬁle merged credit report. If the borrower’s credit ﬁle includes complete and accurate information to ensure the validity of the credit score, the lender does not need to further evaluate the borrower’s creditworthiness.
Note: The credit report will indicate if a credit score could not be produced due to insuﬃcient credit. The credit report must be maintained in the loan ﬁle, whether the report includes traditional credit and a credit score or indicates that a credit score could not be produced due to insuﬃcient or frozen credit.
Minimum Credit Score Requirements
The following table describes the minimum credit score requirements and how to determine the loan-level credit score that applies to loan eligibility.

Published February 5, 2025
Minimum Credit Score
The requirements are published in the Eligibility Matrix
and are based on the credit score and the highest of the
LTV, CLTV, or HCLTV ratios (as applicable); loan purpose;
number of units; amortization type; and DTI ratio. To
determine the credit score that applies for loan eligibility,
use the following:
Loans with one borrower - representative credit score,
Loans with more than one borrower - average median
credit score.
The minimum credit score that applies for loan eligibility
is:
620 — ﬁxed-rate loans
640 — ARMs
DU will determine whether the minimum credit score is
met using the following:
Loan caseﬁles with one borrower - representative credit
score,
Loan caseﬁles with more than one borrower
⚬ the representative score for ReﬁNow loans and loans
that require a minimum credit score other than 620 (such
as loans with multiple ﬁnanced properties); or
⚬ average median credit score.
The minimum credit score that applies to eligibility of the
loan caseﬁle is:
620 — ﬁxed-rate loans and ARMs
The minimum representative credit score is 620.
Manually underwritten loans: Higher of 620
representative credit score or average median credit
score, as applicable, or the minimum representative
credit score required by the variance.
DU loan caseﬁles: Higher of 620 based on the score used
by DU or the minimum representative score required by
the variance.
444
See B3-5.1-02, Determining the Credit Score for a Mortgage Loan for additional information.
Exceptions to the Minimum Credit Score Requirement
Certain transactions are not subject to the minimum credit score requirement, including:
loans where no borrower has a credit score (see Section B3–5.4, Nontraditional Credit History);
manually underwritten HomeReady mortgage loans that include a borrower with a low credit score (see B5-6-02, HomeReady Mortgage Underwriting Methods and Requirements); and
high LTV reﬁnance loans, except for those loans underwritten using the Alternative Qualiﬁcation Path.
DU Credit Score Requirements
Credit scores are not an integral part of DU's risk assessment because DU performs its own analysis of the credit report data. However, lenders must request credit scores for each borrower from each of the three credit repositories when they order the three in-ﬁle merged credit report, described in B3-5.2-01, Requirements for Credit Reports. If one or two of the credit repositories do not contain any credit information for the borrowers who have traditional credit, the credit report is still acceptable as long as
credit data is available from one repository,
a credit score is obtained from that repository, and
the lender requested a three in-ﬁle merged report.
Note: When a loan caseﬁle is submitted to DU for a borrower with a credit score, but only medical tradelines are reported on the credit report, the loan caseﬁle will receive an Out of Scope recommendation. The lender can manually underwrite the loan caseﬁle in accordance with the Selling Guide.
If the transaction does not meet the above requirements, refer to Section B3–5.4, Nontraditional Credit History, for underwriting and eligibility requirements for DU loans in which one or more borrowers do not have a credit score.
Frozen Credit Requirements
If the borrower’s credit information is frozen at one of the credit repositories for borrowers who have traditional credit, the credit report is still acceptable as long as
credit data is available from two repositories,
a credit score is obtained from at least one of those two repositories, and
the lender requested a three in-ﬁle merged report.
Loans for borrowers with credit data frozen at two or more of the credit repositories will not be eligible whether underwritten manually or in DU.
Published February 5, 2025
445
Delivery of Credit Scores
Loan Delivery collects credit score data for each borrower and also at the loan level. Lenders are required to deliver the representative credit score for all loans. This applies even if the average median credit score is used for loan eligibility and may result in delivery of loans with representative scores less than 620. For additional information, see the Loan Delivery Job Aid: Credit Scores.
Loan-Level Price Adjustments Based on Credit Score
Loan-level price adjustments (LLPAs) are assessed based on the representative credit score for the loan, in addition to other eligibility and loan features. See the Loan-Level Price Adjustment (LLPA) Matrix for additional information about LLPAs, including information about how LLPAs are assessed for loans that include borrowers without a credit score.

the same, choose the middle of the three scores. For example: 700, 680, 680 = 680; 700, 700,
680 = 700)
If there is only one borrower, the single score for the borrower is the representative credit score
for the loan.
If there are multiple borrowers, determine the applicable credit score for each individual

borrower and select the lowest applicable score from the group as the representative credit
score for the loan. If there is a borrower who does not have a credit score, determine the
representative credit score for the loan based on the credit scores of the other borrowers on the
loan.
Average Median Credit Score
For certain transactions, the average median credit score is used in place of the representative credit score to determine whether the minimum credit score requirement is met.
The following examples demonstrate how to calculate the average median credit score for eligibility purposes.

Foreign Credit Reports and Credit Scores
With the exception of loan caseﬁles underwritten through DU, Fannie Mae permits the lender to use a credit report from a foreign country to document a borrower's credit history. (See B3-5.2-01, Requirements for Credit Reports.) If a credit score is provided with the foreign credit report it cannot be used to establish eligibility, or be delivered to Fannie Mae unless the credit score is the classic FICO, as required by B3-5.1-01, General Requirements for Credit Scores. See Section B3–5.4, Nontraditional Credit History, for requirements that apply when a loan includes a borrower without an acceptable credit score.

Introduction This topic describes requirements for credit reports, including:
Overview General Requirements Public Records Information Acceptable and Unacceptable Changes Required Creditor Information Format for Reporting Payment History Inquiries Unreported Debts Assessing Borrower Credit Management Skills Credit Report Requirements in Desktop Underwriter Credit Score Requirements
Overview
The lender must obtain a credit report for each borrower on the loan application who has an individual credit record. The credit report must be based on data provided by the national credit repositories. Acceptable credit report formats are described in B3-5.2-02, Types of Credit Reports. For credit report requirements in DU see below.
A nontraditional mortgage credit report or other form of alternative credit veriﬁcation may be used if the borrower
does not have suﬃcient credit to enable the development of a credit score, or
does not use the type of credit that is reported to credit repositories.
See Section B3-5.4, Nontraditional Credit History for additional information.
General Requirements
Credit reports must meet the following general requirements:
The report must include both credit and public record information for each locality in which the borrower has resided during the most recent two-year period. If the lender relies on credit reports from foreign countries to document borrower credit histories, the credit report must meet the requirements and standards for domestic reports, and must be completed in English or include an English translation. (See B3-5.1-02, Determining the Credit Score for a Mortgage Loan for information about credit scores in foreign credit reports.)
The report must include all discovered credit and legal information that is not considered obsolete under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Although the Fair Credit Reporting Act currently speciﬁes that credit
Published February 5, 2025
449
information is not considered obsolete until after seven years, and bankruptcy information after ten years, Fannie Mae requires only a seven-year history to be reviewed for all credit and public record information.
The report must be an original report, with no erasures, white-outs, or alterations. An automated credit report or one that is transmitted by fax is considered to be an “original” report.
The report must include the full name, address, and telephone number of the credit reporting agency, as well as the names of the national repositories that the agency used to provide information for the report.
The credit reporting agency must make responsive statements about all items on the credit report—indicating “unable to verify” or “employer refused to verify,” when appropriate.
Public Records Information
The report must include all available public records information, identify the sources of the public records information, and disclose whether any judgments, foreclosures, tax liens, or bankruptcies were discovered (with these adverse items reported in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and to the extent reported by consumer reporting agencies participating in the National Consumer Assistance Plan).
Acceptable and Unacceptable Changes
Collected credit report information should not be changed. However, it is permissible to delete duplicate information, translate codes to plain language, and make appropriate adjustments to resolve conﬂicting information to ensure the clarity of the report.
The following types of changes are unacceptable:
deleting tradelines that pertain to a borrower’s bankruptcy,
adding a payment amount to a creditor’s tradeline when the creditor does not require a payment, or
restricting information collection to a shorter time period than Fannie Mae requires.
Credit repositories should only change the information called to its attention by a creditor or a party that is not associated with either the real estate sale or purchase transaction or the mortgage ﬁnancing.
Required Creditor Information
For each debt listed, the report must provide:
the creditor’s name,
the date the account was opened,
the amount of the highest credit,
the current status of the account,
the required payment amount,
Published February 5, 2025
450
the unpaid balance, and
a payment history.
The report must indicate the dates that accounts were last updated with the creditors. Each account with a balance must have been checked with the creditor within 90 days of the date of the credit report.
Format for Reporting Payment History
All data must be presented in a format that is easy to read and that is understandable without the need for code translations.
The report must list the historical status of each account. This status must be presented in a “number of times past due” format and include the dates of the delinquencies.
The preferred format is “0 x 30, 0 x 60, 0 x 90 days” late. The following formats are also acceptable:
“Rl, R2, R3, …,” if it also gives historical negative ratings, such as “was R3 in 6/05.”
a consecutive numbering sequence, such as “0001000 …,” provided the meaning is clear from the report.
Statements such as “current,” “satisfactory,” or “as agreed” are not satisfactory by themselves.
Inquiries
The report must generate an inquiry that will appear on future credit reports and must list all inquiries that were made in the previous 90 days.
Unreported Debts
If the credit report does not include a reference for each signiﬁcant open debt on the application, the lender must obtain a separate written veriﬁcation for each unreported debt. The lender also needs to verify separately accounts listed as “will rate by mail only” or “need written authorization.”
Assessing Borrower Credit Management Skills
The borrower’s credit management skills can be assessed by analyzing repayment patterns, credit utilization, and level of experience in using credit.
Credit Report Requirements in Desktop Underwriter
Lenders are required to request a three in-ﬁle merged credit report from one of the credit information providers listed on Fannie Mae's website. The credit report used by DU in the ﬁnal loan caseﬁle submission must be maintained in the mortgage loan ﬁle. A DU observation message will identify all of the credit reports evaluated by DU during the loan submission. The version of the credit report received by DU must meet the requirements
Published February 5, 2025
451
in this topic and be one that supports trended credit data. Trended credit data is expanded information on a borrower’s credit history at a tradeline level on several monthly factors, including: amount owed, minimum payment, and payment made.
Note: To obtain a credit report that is compatible with DU loan caseﬁle requirements, the borrower's present address must be within the U.S. or U.S. territories, with the exception of an Army Post Oﬃce (APO), Fleet Post Oﬃce (FPO), or Diplomatic Post Oﬃce (DPO) military address. Borrowers with foreign credit reports must be manually underwritten.
Credit Score Requirements

B3-5.2-02, Types of Credit Reports (12/19/2017)
Introduction This topic contains information on the types of credit reports that are accepted by Fannie Mae, including:
In-File Credit Reports Automated Merged Credit Reports Residential Mortgage Credit Reports
In-File Credit Reports
An in-ﬁle credit report provides credit and public record information obtained from one or more credit repositories. The report contains “as is” information, which typically has not been updated or re-veriﬁed as a
Published February 5, 2025
452
result of the credit inquiry.
The report must meet the following requirements:
The report should include all information from three diﬀerent credit repositories, or two repositories, if:
that is the extent of the data available for the borrower, or
the borrower’s credit information is frozen at one credit repository.
If only one in-ﬁle credit report is available for a borrower, this is acceptable if the lender is able to obtain a credit score for the borrower and the lender requested information from three credit repositories.
If the report does not include a reference for each signiﬁcant debt reported by the borrower on the loan application, the lender must obtain a separate written veriﬁcation for each unreported (or unrated) debt.
If the report lists accounts that were not checked with the creditor within 90 days of the date of the in-ﬁle report, the lender must obtain an updated credit report or a separate written veriﬁcation for those accounts.
Automated Merged Credit Reports
An automated merged credit report combines the in-ﬁle credit reports from multiple repositories into a single report. A joint merged credit report includes all credit repository credit data on more than one individual applicant.
The report must meet the following requirements:
The report must include all information from three diﬀerent credit repositories, or two repositories, if:
that is the extent of the data available for the borrower, or
the borrower’s credit information is frozen at one credit repository.
If information from only one credit repository is available, this is acceptable if the lender is able to obtain a credit score for the borrower and the lender requested information from three diﬀerent credit repositories.
The report cannot be provided by a credit reporting agency that is aﬃliated with the lender in any way.
The report must include all information reported for the borrower from the in-ﬁle credit reports.
The report must identify the repositories that were used for the in-ﬁle credit reports.
The report does not have to repeat duplicate information that is in in-ﬁle credit reports. However, if duplicate information is not exactly the same on each report, the automated merged report must either repeat the information or include the most derogatory of the duplicate information that pertains to payment history and/or current payment status.
Residential Mortgage Credit Reports
A residential mortgage credit report is a detailed account of the borrower’s credit, employment, and residency history, as well as public records information.
Published February 5, 2025
453
The report must meet the following requirements:
The credit reporting agency must contact at least two national repositories of accumulated credit records for each locality in which the borrower has lived during the most recent two-year period.
All information must be obtained from, or veriﬁed by, sources other than the borrower. When co- borrowers have individually obtained credit, separate repository inquiries are necessary, although the results of both reports may be combined in one report, as long as the report clearly indicates that this has been done.
The credit reporting agency must verify, either in writing or by telephone, the borrower’s current employment and income (if it can be obtained). If the borrower has changed jobs in the past two years, the credit report also must mention the borrower’s previous employment and income.
The report must include a positive statement that the employment was veriﬁed, the date of the veriﬁcation, and the name of the individual who conﬁrmed the employment. If this information was not obtained by an employer interview, the credit reporting agency must indicate why that was not done.
The report must include the name of the party who ordered the report. If another party paid for the report, the credit report must provide that party’s name, unless the lender ordered the report and the billed party has a documented agent or corporate relationship with the lender.
The original report must be delivered to the oﬃce of the party who requested it, using any means acceptable under the Fair Credit Reporting Act or other similar regulations, such as sending it through the U.S. postal system, by messenger, over a fax machine, or through other automated means.
The report must include a certiﬁcation that it meets the standards for a residential mortgage credit report.
When the credit reporting agency has incomplete information, discovers that the borrower might not have disclosed all information that should be found in the public records, or obtains other information that indicates the possible existence of undisclosed credit records, the credit reporting agency must interview the borrower(s) to obtain additional information that is needed to provide an accurate report or perform additional research to verify whether the purported undisclosed records actually exist.

B3-5.2-03, Accuracy of Credit Information in a Credit Report
(07/25/2017)
Introduction This topic contains information on the following:
Accuracy of Credit Information in a Credit Report Disputed Tradelines
Published February 5, 2025
454
Accuracy of Credit Information in a Credit Report
For all mortgage loans (including DU loan caseﬁles and manually underwritten loans), the lender is responsible for reviewing the credit report, as well as all credit information, to determine that the credit report meets Fannie Mae's requirements and that the data evaluated by DU was accurate.
If a borrower indicates that any signiﬁcant information in the credit ﬁle is inaccurate—such as reported accounts that do not belong to the borrower or derogatory information that is reported in error—the lender should carefully review the credit information with the borrower, then request the credit reporting company that provided the information to conﬁrm its accuracy.
Disputed Tradelines
Manually Underwritten Loans
If the borrower has disputed information in their credit ﬁle, and the credit reporting company conﬁrms that the disputed information is incorrect or incomplete and underwriting the loan needs to be completed before the credit ﬁles can be corrected, the lender cannot use the credit score(s) when manually underwriting the loan. Instead, the credit risk assessment must be based on a review of the borrower’s traditional credit history.
If there are multiple disputed tradelines or a dispute on a mortgage tradeline, the lender should obtain correspondence directly from the borrower indicating the reason for the dispute. The aspect of the tradeline–such as balance and payment history–that is being disputed is of particular interest when considering the impact to the borrower’s overall credit proﬁle.
The lender is responsible for determining whether the borrower’s explanation is reasonable and/or whether additional documentation (such as canceled checks) is necessary to disprove the adverse information. Lenders are not required to investigate disputed medical tradelines.
DU Loans
For loan caseﬁles underwritten through DU, DU will indicate if the lender is required to investigate the disputed account to determine if the account belongs to the borrower and conﬁrm the accuracy and completeness of the information reported on the account.
See B3-2-09, Erroneous Credit Report Data; B3-2-10, Accuracy of DU Data, DU Tolerances, and Errors in the Credit Report; and B3-5.3-09, DU Credit Report Analysis for additional information.

Introduction This topic contains information on the number and age of accounts.
Number and Age of Accounts
Number and Age of Accounts
The lender must review the borrower’s credit report to determine whether they have an older established credit history or a newly established credit history, and whether there are a signiﬁcant number of recently opened accounts or a mix of new accounts and older accounts.
Credit histories that include older, established accounts generally represent lower credit risk. However, an older, established credit history that includes a signiﬁcant number of recently opened accounts may indicate that the borrower is overextended, and thus will represent a higher credit risk.
A newly established credit history does not automatically represent a higher credit risk, since making payments as agreed on newly opened accounts represents less of a risk than not making payments as agreed on older, established accounts.

Introduction This topic contains information on the borrower’s payment history.
Payment History
Payment History
The lender must review the borrower’s credit report to determine the current status of each credit account (including mortgage accounts), the timeliness of payments, and the frequency, recency, and severity of any delinquent payments.
Credit histories that include no late payments, collection or charged-oﬀ accounts, foreclosures, deeds-in- lieu, bankruptcies, or other public records information represent a lower credit risk.
Published February 5, 2025
456
Credit histories that include recent late payments represent a higher credit risk than those with late payments that occurred more than 24 months ago. When there are payments that were 30, 60, or 90 days (or longer) past due, the lender must determine whether the late payments represent isolated incidences or frequent occurrences. Delinquent payments must be evaluated in the context of the borrower’s overall credit history, including the number and age of accounts, credit utilization, and recent attempts to obtain new credit. For example, a credit history that includes delinquent payments along with recent inquiries and a high balances-to-limits ratio indicates a high credit risk.
Credit histories that include foreclosures, deeds-in-lieu, and public records information (such as bankruptcies, judgments, and liens) represent a higher credit risk. The greater the number of such incidences and the more recently they occurred, the higher the credit risk.

B3-5.3-03, Previous Mortgage Payment History (07/25/2017)
Introduction This topic contains information on previous mortgage payment history requirements, including:
Documenting Previous Mortgage History Standard Mortgage Veriﬁcations from Servicers Existing Mortgage Payment Requirements Excessive Mortgage Delinquency
Documenting Previous Mortgage History
The lender must review the borrower's credit report to determine the status of all mortgage accounts. If a borrower had previous mortgages, the lender does not have to independently verify the mortgage’s payment history provided the credit report includes a reference to the mortgage (or mortgages) and reﬂects 12 months of the most recent payment activity.
If adequate mortgage payment history is not included in the borrower’s credit report, the lender must use the following to verify the borrower’s payment history on a previous mortgage(s):
a standard mortgage veriﬁcation;
loan payment history from the servicer;
the borrower’s canceled checks for the last 12 months; or
the borrower’s year-end mortgage account statement, provided the statement includes a payment receipt history, and, if applicable, canceled checks for the months elapsed since the year-end mortgage
Published February 5, 2025
457
account statement was issued.
Standard Mortgage Veriﬁcations from Servicers
When a lender relies on standard mortgage veriﬁcations from servicers or holders, it must ensure that the veriﬁcations include:
the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage and monthly payment amount;
the present status of the mortgage, such as current, 30 days’ delinquent, etc.; and
the borrower’s payment history.
When a servicer fails to provide all of the requested information, the lender must rely on information provided through the borrower’s canceled checks. The checks must:
be legible,
identify the mortgage servicer or mortgage holder as the payee,
indicate that the servicer or holder endorsed the check for deposit, and
indicate the date the servicer or holder deposited the check.
Existing Mortgage Payment Requirements
On the date of the loan application, the borrower’s existing mortgage must be current, which means that no more than 45 days may have elapsed since the last paid installment date.
Excessive Mortgage Delinquency
The lender must review the borrower’s credit history to determine previous mortgage delinquency, severity (e.g., 30, 60, or 90 days), and recency of the delinquency. Loans with excessive prior mortgage delinquencies are not eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae. Excessive prior mortgage delinquency is deﬁned as any mortgage tradeline that has one or more 60-, 90-, 120-, or 150-day delinquency reported within the 12 months prior to the credit report date. See B3-5.3-02, Payment History, and B3-5.3-07, Signiﬁcant Derogatory Credit Events — Waiting Periods and Re-establishing Credit for additional information.
Note: For purposes of complying with the guidelines in this topic, timeshare accounts identiﬁed as mortgage tradelines are not required to meet the requirements described above, and are considered to be installment accounts.

(04/01/2009)
Introduction This topic contains information on inquiries: recent attempts to obtain new credit.
Inquiries: Recent Attempts to Obtain New Credit
Inquiries: Recent Attempts to Obtain New Credit
The lender must review the section of the borrower’s credit report that indicates the presence of creditor inquiries to determine the number and recency of the inquiries.
Recent inquiries may indicate that the borrower has been actively seeking new credit accounts. The presence of a large number of unrelated inquiries represents higher credit risk (whether or not the borrower actually obtained credit as a result of the inquiry). The presence of many recent inquiries in combination with a signiﬁcant number of recently opened accounts or delinquent accounts represents a high credit risk.
When the credit report indicates that recent inquiries took place, the lender must conﬁrm that the borrower has not obtained any additional credit that is not reﬂected in the credit report or the mortgage application. If additional credit was obtained, a veriﬁcation of that debt must be provided and the borrower must be qualiﬁed with the monthly payment.

Published February 5, 2025
459
the credit limit. Patterns of revolving credit spending are credit risk indicative.
Credit histories that include revolving accounts with a low balances-to-limits ratio generally represent a lower credit risk, while those that include accounts with a high balances-to-limits ratio represent a higher credit risk.
A credit history that includes recently opened accounts that are at or near their limits may indicate that the borrower is overextended or overly reliant on the use of revolving credit—and, when this is combined with a delinquent payment history, it is generally an indication that the borrower has not managed their credit successfully.
Note: Lenders are not required to analyze trended credit data in the credit report. See B3-5.2-01, Requirements for Credit Reports, for additional information.

B3-5.3-06, Authorized Users of Credit (10/30/2009)
Introduction This topic contains information on authorized users of credit
Authorized Users of Credit Consideration of Authorized User Accounts
Authorized Users of Credit
When a credit account owner permits another person, typically a family member who is managing credit for the ﬁrst time, to have access to and use an account, the user is referred to as an authorized user of the account. This practice is intended to assist related individuals in legitimately establishing a credit history and credit score based on the account and payment history of the account owner, even though the authorized user is not the account owner.
Consideration of Authorized User Accounts
For manually underwritten loans, credit report tradelines that list a borrower as an authorized user cannot be considered in the underwriting decision, except as outlined below.
An authorized user tradeline may be considered if:
another borrower in the mortgage transaction is the owner of the tradeline; or
the borrower can provide written documentation (e.g., canceled checks, payment receipts, etc.) that they have been the actual and sole payer of the monthly payment on the account for at least 12 months
Published February 5, 2025
460
preceding the date of the application.
If written documentation of the borrower’s monthly payments on the authorized user tradeline is provided, then the payment history — particularly any late payments that are indicated — must be considered in the credit analysis and the monthly payment obligation must be included in the debt-to-income ratio.
An authorized user tradeline must be considered if the owner of the tradeline is the borrower's spouse and the spouse is not a borrower in the mortgage transaction.
These requirements do not apply to loan caseﬁles underwritten through DU. For DU requirements, see B3-5.3-09, DU Credit Report Analysis.

B3-5.3-07, Signiﬁcant Derogatory Credit Events — Waiting Periods
and Re-establishing Credit (08/07/2019)
Introduction This topic contains information on the waiting periods for signiﬁcant derogatory credit events, including:
General Information Identiﬁcation of Signiﬁcant Derogatory Credit Events in the Credit Report Bankruptcy (Chapter 7 or Chapter 11) Bankruptcy (Chapter 13) Multiple Bankruptcy Filings Foreclosure Foreclosure and Bankruptcy on the Same Mortgage Deed-in-Lieu of Foreclosure, Preforeclosure Sale, and Charge-Oﬀ of a Mortgage Account Summary — All Waiting Period Requirements Requirements for Re-establishing Credit
General Information
The presence of signiﬁcant derogatory credit events dramatically increases the likelihood of a future default and represents a signiﬁcantly higher level of default risk. Examples of signiﬁcant derogatory credit events include bankruptcies, foreclosures, deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure, preforeclosure sales, short sales, and charge-oﬀs of mortgage accounts.
Note: The terms “preforeclosure sale” and “short sale” are used interchangeably in this Guide and have the same meaning (see Deed-in-Lieu of Foreclosure, Preforeclosure Sale, and Charge-Oﬀ of a Mortgage Account below).
Published February 5, 2025
461
The lender must determine the cause and signiﬁcance of the derogatory information, verify that suﬃcient time has elapsed since the date of the last derogatory information, and conﬁrm that the borrower has re-established an acceptable credit history. The lender must make the ﬁnal decision about the acceptability of a borrower’s credit history when signiﬁcant derogatory credit information exists.
This topic describes the amount of time that must elapse (the “waiting period”) after a signiﬁcant derogatory credit event before the borrower is eligible for a new loan salable to Fannie Mae. The waiting period commences on the completion, discharge, or dismissal date (as applicable) of the derogatory credit event and ends on the disbursement date of the new loan for manually underwritten loans. See B3-5.3-09, DU Credit Report Analysis, for additional information pertaining to DU loan caseﬁles, including how the waiting period is determined. Also see B3-5.3-08, Extenuating Circumstances for Derogatory Credit, for additional information.
Note: The requirements pertaining to signiﬁcant derogatory credit are not applicable to high LTV reﬁnance loans. (See B5-7-02, High LTV Reﬁnance Underwriting, Documentation, and Collateral Requirements for the New Loan.)
Identiﬁcation of Signiﬁcant Derogatory Credit Events in the Credit Report
Lenders must review the credit report and the Declarations in the loan application to identify instances of signiﬁcant derogatory credit events. Lenders must review the public records section of the credit report and all tradelines, including mortgage accounts (ﬁrst liens, second liens, home improvement loans, HELOCs, and manufactured home loans), to identify previous foreclosures, deeds-in-lieu, preforeclosure sales, charge-oﬀs of mortgage accounts, and bankruptcies. Lenders must carefully review the current status of each tradeline, manner of payment codes, and remarks to identify these types of signiﬁcant derogatory credit events. Remarks Codes are descriptive text or codes that appear on a tradeline, such as “Foreclosure,” “Forfeit deed-in-lieu of foreclosure,” and “Settled for less than full balance.”
Signiﬁcant derogatory credit events may not be accurately reported or consistently reported in the same manner by all creditors or credit reporting agencies. If not clearly identiﬁed in the credit report, the lender must obtain copies of appropriate documentation. The documentation must establish the completion date of a previous foreclosure, deed-in-lieu or preforeclosure sale, or date of the charge-oﬀ of a mortgage account; conﬁrm the bankruptcy discharge or dismissal date; and identify debts that were not satisﬁed by the bankruptcy. Debts that were not satisﬁed by a bankruptcy must be paid oﬀ or have an acceptable, established repayment schedule.
Note: Timeshare accounts are considered installment loans and are not subject to the waiting periods described below.
Bankruptcy (Chapter 7 or Chapter 11)
A four-year waiting period is required, measured from the discharge or dismissal date of the bankruptcy action.
Exceptions for Extenuating Circumstances
A two-year waiting period is permitted if extenuating circumstances can be documented, and is measured from the discharge or dismissal date of the bankruptcy action.
Published February 5, 2025
462
Bankruptcy (Chapter 13)
A distinction is made between Chapter 13 bankruptcies that were discharged and those that were dismissed. The waiting period required for Chapter 13 bankruptcy actions is measured as follows:
two years from the discharge date, or
four years from the dismissal date.
The shorter waiting period based on the discharge date recognizes that borrowers have already met a portion of the waiting period within the time needed for the successful completion of a Chapter 13 plan and subsequent discharge. A borrower who was unable to complete the Chapter 13 plan and received a dismissal will be held to a four-year waiting period.
Exceptions for Extenuating Circumstances
A two-year waiting period is permitted after a Chapter 13 dismissal, if extenuating circumstances can be documented. There are no exceptions permitted to the two-year waiting period after a Chapter 13 discharge.
Multiple Bankruptcy Filings
For a borrower with more than one bankruptcy ﬁling within the past seven years, a ﬁve-year waiting period is required, measured from the most recent dismissal or discharge date.
Note: The presence of multiple bankruptcies in the borrower’s credit history is evidence of signiﬁcant derogatory credit and increases the likelihood of future default. Two or more borrowers with individual bankruptcies are not cumulative, and do not constitute multiple bankruptcies. For example, if the borrower has one bankruptcy and the co-borrower has one bankruptcy this is not considered a multiple bankruptcy.
Exceptions for Extenuating Circumstances
A three-year waiting period is permitted if extenuating circumstances can be documented, and is measured from the most recent bankruptcy discharge or dismissal date. The most recent bankruptcy ﬁling must have been the result of extenuating circumstances.
Foreclosure
A seven-year waiting period is required, and is measured from the completion date of the foreclosure action as reported on the credit report or other foreclosure documents provided by the borrower.
Exceptions for Extenuating Circumstances
A three-year waiting period is permitted if extenuating circumstances can be documented, and is measured from the completion date of the foreclosure action. Additional requirements apply between three and seven years, which include:

Maximum LTV, CLTV, or HCLTV ratios of the lesser of 90% or the maximum LTV, CLTV, or HCLTV ratios for the transaction per the Eligibility Matrix.
The purchase of a principal residence is permitted.
Limited cash-out reﬁnances are permitted for all occupancy types pursuant to the eligibility requirements in eﬀect at that time.
Note: The purchase of second homes or investment properties and cash-out reﬁnances (any occupancy type) are not permitted until a seven-year waiting period has elapsed.
Foreclosure and Bankruptcy on the Same Mortgage
If a mortgage debt was discharged through a bankruptcy, the bankruptcy waiting periods may be applied if the lender obtains the appropriate documentation to verify that the mortgage obligation was discharged in the bankruptcy. Otherwise, the greater of the applicable bankruptcy or foreclosure waiting periods must be applied.
Deed-in-Lieu of Foreclosure, Preforeclosure Sale, and Charge-Oﬀ of a Mortgage Account
These transaction types are completed as alternatives to foreclosure.
A deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is a transaction in which the deed to the real property is transferred back to the servicer. These are typically identiﬁed on the credit report through Remarks Codes such as “Forfeit deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.”
A preforeclosure sale or short sale is the sale of a property in lieu of a foreclosure resulting in a payoﬀ of less than the total amount owed, which was pre-approved by the servicer. These are typically identiﬁed on the credit report through Remarks Codes such as “Settled for less than full balance.”
A charge-oﬀ of a mortgage account occurs when a creditor has determined that there is little (or no) likelihood that the mortgage debt will be collected. A charge-oﬀ is typically reported after an account reaches a certain delinquency status, and is identiﬁed on the credit report with a manner of payment (MOP) code of “9.”
A four-year waiting period is required from the completion date of the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, preforeclosure sale, or charge-oﬀ as reported on the credit report or other documents provided by the borrower.
Exceptions for Extenuating Circumstances
A two-year waiting period is permitted if extenuating circumstances can be documented.
Note: Deeds-in-lieu and preforeclosure sales may not be accurately or consistently reported in the same manner by all creditors or credit reporting agencies. See Identiﬁcation of Signiﬁcant Derogatory Credit Events in the Credit Report above for additional information.

B3-5.3-08, Extenuating Circumstances for Derogatory Credit
(12/16/2014)
Introduction This topic provides information on extenuating circumstances for derogatory credit information.
Extenuating Circumstances
Extenuating Circumstances
Extenuating circumstances are nonrecurring events that are beyond the borrower’s control that result in a sudden, signiﬁcant, and prolonged reduction in income or a catastrophic increase in ﬁnancial obligations.
If a borrower claims that derogatory information is the result of extenuating circumstances, the lender must substantiate the borrower’s claim. Examples of documentation that can be used to support extenuating circumstances include
documents that conﬁrm the event
such as a copy of a divorce decree, medical reports or bills, notice of job layoﬀ, job severance papers, etc.; and
documents that illustrate factors that contributed to the borrower’s inability to resolve the problems that
Published February 5, 2025
466
resulted from the event
such as a copy of insurance papers or claim settlements, property listing agreements, lease agreements, tax returns (covering the periods prior to, during, and after a loss of employment), etc.
The lender must obtain a written explanation from the borrower explaining the relevance of the documentation. The written explanation must support the claims of extenuating circumstances, conﬁrm the nature of the event that led to the bankruptcy or foreclosure-related action, and illustrate that the borrower had no reasonable options other than to default on his or her ﬁnancial obligations. The written explanation may be in the form of a letter from the borrower, an email from the borrower, or some other form of written documentation provided by the borrower.

B3-5.3-09, DU Credit Report Analysis (02/05/2025)
Introduction This topic describes how DU analyzes credit report data and requirements lenders must follow in response to the credit-related Findings messages. This topic includes:
Inquiries Trended Credit Data Omitted Accounts Authorized User Tradelines Disputed Credit Report Tradelines DU Debt Comparison Contradictory, Derogatory, or Erroneous Information Duplicate Public Records Judgments and Liens Mortgage Delinquencies Past-Due, Collection, and Charge-Oﬀ of Non-Mortgage Accounts Prior Bankruptcy, Foreclosure, Deed-in-Lieu of Foreclosure, Preforeclosure Sales, and Charge-Oﬀ of Mortgage Accounts Bankruptcy Foreclosure Deed-in-Lieu of Foreclosure Preforeclosure Sales or Short Sales Charge-Oﬀ of Mortgage Accounts
Inquiries
Published February 5, 2025
467
The lender should examine inquiries to determine whether they represent potential sources of undisclosed credit. If new debt was obtained, the lender may need to correct the loan application and resubmit it.
Trended Credit Data
Lenders are not required to analyze trended credit data in the credit report. For more information, see B3-2-03, Risk Factors Evaluated by DU.
Omitted Accounts
Supporting documentation is required when a credit report liability with a balance greater than zero is omitted from the loan application.
Authorized User Tradelines
DU takes credit report tradelines designated as authorized user tradelines into consideration as part of the DU credit risk assessment. However the lender must review credit report tradelines in which the applicant has been designated as an authorized user in order to ensure the tradelines are an accurate reﬂection of the borrower's credit history. If the lender believes the authorized user tradelines are not an accurate reﬂection of the borrower's credit history, the lender should evaluate the borrower's credit history without the beneﬁt of these tradelines and use prudent underwriting judgment when making its ﬁnal underwriting decision. In order to assist the lender in its review of authorized user tradelines, DU issues a message providing the name of the creditor and account number for each authorized user tradeline identiﬁed.
When ensuring tradelines are an accurate reﬂection of the borrower's credit history, as a general guide, if the borrower has several authorized user accounts but only has a few accounts of their own, the lender should establish:
the relationship of the borrower to the owner of the account,
if the borrower uses the account, and
if the borrower makes the payments on the account.
If the authorized user tradeline belongs to another borrower on the mortgage loan, no additional investigation is needed. On the other hand, if the borrower has several tradelines in good standing and only a minor number of authorized user accounts, the lender could make the determination that:
the authorized user accounts had minimal, if any, impact on the borrower's overall credit proﬁle; and
the information reported on the credit report is an accurate reﬂection of the borrower's credit history.
The lender is not required to review an authorized user tradelines that belongs to the borrower's spouse when the spouse is not on the mortgage transaction.
For manual underwriting consideration of authorized users of credit, see B3-5.3-06, Authorized Users of Credit.
Published February 5, 2025
468
Disputed Credit Report Tradelines
When the credit report contains tradelines disputed by the borrower, DU will ﬁrst assess the risk of the loan caseﬁle using all tradelines, including those disputed. If DU issues an Approve recommendation using the disputed tradelines, no further documentation or action is necessary. DU will issue a message speciﬁc to this scenario.
If DU does not issue an Approve recommendation when including the disputed tradelines, DU will re-assess the risk without using the disputed tradelines. If DU is then able to issue an Approve recommendation, the lender must investigate the tradelines to determine whether the borrower is responsible for the accounts or if the account information is accurate or complete.
If the borrower is not responsible for the disputed accounts, the lender must obtain supporting documentation and may deliver the loan as a DU loan. No further action is necessary regarding the disputed tradelines.
If the borrower is responsible for the disputed account, the lender must investigate the information, including determining the aspect of the tradeline that is being disputed. If the borrower is able to provide documentation to disprove any adverse information (such as canceled checks), the lender may deliver the loan as a DU loan.
If the borrower is responsible for the disputed account and the account and tradeline information is accurate and complete, the loan is not eligible for delivery as a DU loan. The lender may manually underwrite the loan if the transaction is eligible for manual underwriting.
The monthly payments for the disputed tradelines must be included in the debt-to-income ratio if the accounts belong to the borrower.
Note: Tradelines reported as medical debt are not shown in the disputed tradeline message. Therefore, lenders are not required to investigate disputed medical tradelines.
Examples
The following scenarios are examples of when a loan receiving an Approve/Eligible recommendation with the disputed tradeline(s) excluded from DU's risk assessment would be eligible for delivery as a DU loan:
A borrower’s account was referred for collection by the creditor. Subsequently, the borrower paid oﬀ the account, but the pay-oﬀ was not reported on the tradeline. The borrower requested that a dispute be placed on the tradeline. The tradeline information was accurate, but because it did not reﬂect that the borrower paid oﬀ the account, it may be considered incomplete. The borrower must provide documentation that the account was paid in full.
A borrower and his son have the same name (Sr. and Jr.). The borrower’s credit report contains a tradeline that actually belongs to the son. The tradeline is reported as disputed. The borrower can provide conﬁrmation that they are not obligated on the account.
The servicer of a disputed loan indicates a late payment in January of the previous year. The borrower can provide documentation (such as canceled checks or bank statements) that indicate that the payment was made on time.
The following scenario is an example of when a loan receiving an Approve/Eligible recommendation with the
Published February 5, 2025
469
disputed tradeline(s) excluded from DU’s risk assessment would not be eligible for delivery as a DU loan:
The credit report indicates a disputed tradeline on the borrower’s mortgage being reﬁnanced. The tradeline indicates a 60–day late payment in January of the previous year. The borrower cannot provide any documentation to support that the payment was made on time.
DU Debt Comparison
DU compares the balances and payments of the debts on the credit report with the debts on the loan application. If material diﬀerences are found, the lender must conﬁrm that all debts from the credit report are included on the loan application and provide documentation to support the use of payments and balances lower than those on the credit report. If the debt aﬀects the debt-to-income ratio by more than the allowable tolerances, the lender must add the debt to the loan application and resubmit the loan. Otherwise, the lender is expected to provide documentation that supports the omission from the loan application. See B3-6-02, Debt-to- Income Ratios, and B3-2-10, Accuracy of DU Data, DU Tolerances, and Errors in the Credit Report, for additional information.)
Contradictory, Derogatory, or Erroneous Information
Lenders are obligated to take action when contradictory, derogatory, or erroneous information would justify additional investigation or would provide grounds for a decision that is diﬀerent from the recommendation DU delivers. For example, if the credit report reﬂects a previous foreclosure but the information was not accurately mapped to DU, the lender must consider this when making its ﬁnal underwriting decision.
Duplicate Public Records
Items that typically appear in the Public Records section of the credit report (judgments, bankruptcies, foreclosures, and tax liens) are often duplicated because the credit agencies may not attempt to merge items of this severe nature. As a result, these items may also appear in more than one veriﬁcation message in the Underwriting Findings report. If it is clear from the credit report data that the items are duplicates (identical account numbers, date ﬁled, and dollar amounts), the lender can disregard the duplicates and document the item once. However, if it is unclear from the credit report whether any of the items are duplicated, the lender should treat each item individually and obtain the required documentation for each item, as indicated in the veriﬁcation messages.
Judgments and Liens
Open judgments and all outstanding liens that are in the Public Records section of the credit report will be identiﬁed in the Underwriting Findings report, and must be paid oﬀ at or prior to closing. Documentation of the satisfaction of these liabilities, along with veriﬁcation of funds suﬃcient to satisfy these obligations, must also be maintained in the permanent loan ﬁle.
Mortgage Delinquencies
Published February 5, 2025
470
DU applies the following guidelines to the processing of loans with mortgage delinquencies:
If any borrower’s credit report contains a mortgage tradeline that is 60 or more days past due when the account was last reported by the creditor and the account was reported within the 12 months prior to the credit report date, the loan caseﬁle will receive an Ineligible recommendation and will be ineligible for delivery to Fannie Mae.
If there is a mortgage that is disclosed on the loan application but not reported on the credit report, or the mortgage is on the credit report with an outstanding balance but the payment history has not been reported in the last six months, DU will issue a message requiring the lender to conﬁrm that the account is not two or more payments past due as of the date of the application and that it has not been past due by two or more payments in the last 12 months. If the lender determines that the borrower does have a mortgage that is past due by two or more payments or has been past due by two or more payments in the last 12 months, then the loan caseﬁle is not eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae.
Borrowers may not bring past-due mortgage accounts current prior to closing in order to circumvent Fannie Mae’s policy regarding past-due mortgages. However, the lender may apply some discretion with regard to the application of this policy if it determines and documents that the past-due account status was not the fault of the borrower—for example, if the servicer misapplied or lost the borrower’s payment.
Loan caseﬁles will receive an Ineligible recommendation due to excessive prior mortgage delinquency if the borrower has a mortgage tradeline on their credit report that has one or more 60-, 90-, 120-, or 150- day delinquency reported within the 12 months prior to the credit report date.
The above policies will apply to all mortgage tradelines, including ﬁrst liens, second liens, home improvement loans, HELOCs, and manufactured home loans.
Underwriting when the Credit Report Contains Inaccurate Mortgage Delinquency Information
When DU identiﬁes a mortgage delinquency on the credit report and the information is inaccurate, the lender may instruct DU to disregard the mortgage delinquency information on the credit report. This is done by entering “Conﬁrmed Mtg Del Incorrect” in the online loan application and resubmitting the loan caseﬁle to DU. When the loan caseﬁle is resubmitted to DU, the mortgage delinquency information on the credit report will not be used.
If the lender enters “Conﬁrmed Mtg Del Incorrect”, the lender must document that the mortgage is not currently 60 days or more past due, and has not been 60 days or more past due in the last 12 months.
Past-Due, Collection, and Charge-Oﬀ of Non-Mortgage Accounts
Accounts that are reported as past due (not reported as collection accounts) must be brought current. Medical collection accounts are excluded from the limits below and are not required to be paid in full at or prior to closing.
For one-unit, principal residence properties, borrowers are not required to pay oﬀ outstanding collections or non-mortgage charge-oﬀs—regardless of the amount.
Note: If the lender marks the collection account Paid By Close in the online loan application, DU will issue a message in the DU Underwriting Findings report stating that the collection must be paid.
Published February 5, 2025
471
For two- to four-unit owner-occupied and second home properties, collections and non-mortgage charge- oﬀs totaling more than $5,000 must be paid in full prior to or at closing.
For investment properties, individual collection and non-mortgage charge-oﬀ accounts equal to or greater than $250 and accounts that total more than $1,000 must be paid in full prior to or at closing.
Prior Bankruptcy, Foreclosure, Deed-in-Lieu of Foreclosure, Preforeclosure Sales, and Charge-Oﬀ of Mortgage Accounts
Per the requirements of B3-5.3-07, Signiﬁcant Derogatory Credit Events — Waiting Periods and Re-establishing Credit, an amount of time must elapse (the “waiting period”) after a signiﬁcant derogatory credit event before the borrower is eligible for a new loan salable to Fannie Mae. The waiting period commences on the completion, discharge, or dismissal date (as applicable) of the derogatory credit event and ends on the disbursement date of the new loan. Because DU does not have the disbursement date of the subject loan, DU uses the date of the credit report to measure whether or not the applicable waiting period has been met. However, because the credit report date may not result in an accurate calculation of the waiting period (it is earlier than the disbursement date), the lender may use the disbursement date to conﬁrm that the waiting period has been met. See the table below for additional information.

disbursement date of the new loan.
If the completion, discharge, or dismissal dates (as

but do not appear to comply with the applicable

waiting period requirements, an
Ineligible recommendation will be issued. DU uses the
date of the credit report to determine whether or not
the applicable waiting period has been met. The lender
may obtain an updated credit report and resubmit the
loan caseﬁle to DU after the required time has elapsed
or manually underwrite the loan using the
disbursement date to conﬁrm that the waiting period
has been met.
If the completion, discharge, or dismissal dates (as
applicable) reﬂected in the credit report are
incomplete, the lender must conﬁrm that the waiting
period has been met and may base its determination
on the disbursement date of the new loan.
DU will determine if the date of the event was within

the applicable waiting period. However, the
recommendation will not be changed and the lender
must conﬁrm the waiting period requirement has been

disbursement date of the new loan.
Note: See B3-5.3-07, Signiﬁcant Derogatory Credit Events — Waiting Periods and Re-establishing Credit, for additional information regarding signiﬁcant derogatory events. DU is not able to identify whether the borrower’s derogatory credit event(s) was the result of extenuating circumstances. See below for information on how to treat extenuating circumstances and B3-5.3-08, Extenuating Circumstances for Derogatory Credit, for additional information.
Bankruptcy
Published February 5, 2025
473
DU applies the following guidelines to prior bankruptcies:
If a Chapter 13 bankruptcy was discharged within the last two years, dismissed within the last four years, or ﬁled but neither discharged nor dismissed within the last four years, the loan caseﬁle will receive an Ineligible recommendation and will be ineligible for delivery to Fannie Mae.
If a non-Chapter 13 bankruptcy was ﬁled, discharged, or dismissed within the last four years, the loan caseﬁle will receive an Ineligible recommendation and will be ineligible for delivery to Fannie Mae.
DU will not take bankruptcy information in the public record section of the credit report into account if the bankruptcy is dated more than seven years prior to the credit report date.
DU will not take tradeline accounts that are reported with a bankruptcy status code or manner of payment (MOP) code of “7” into account if there is at least one bankruptcy reported in a public record within seven years of the credit report date. In this scenario, DU assumes the date ﬁled and the date discharged in the public record are more accurate than the dates in the tradeline; i.e., speciﬁc ﬁled and discharged dates do not exist in the tradeline.
DU will use tradeline accounts that are reported with a bankruptcy status code or MOP code of “7” if there is not a bankruptcy reported in a public record within seven years of the credit report date. In this scenario, the lender will need to verify the actual ﬁled and discharged dates to determine that the bankruptcy meets the DU bankruptcy policy.
DU is not able to determine if multiple ﬁlings have occurred due to the manner in which bankruptcies are reported to the credit report. DU will issue a message when it appears that there may have been multiple bankruptcy ﬁlings. This message will list each of the bankruptcies seen on the credit report, and will instruct lenders to ensure the loan caseﬁle meets the criteria for underwriting loan caseﬁles with multiple bankruptcies.
Underwriting when the Credit Report Contains Inaccurate Bankruptcy Information
When DU identiﬁes a bankruptcy on the credit report and the information is inaccurate, the lender may instruct DU to disregard the bankruptcy information on the credit report in the eligibility assessment. This is done by entering “Conﬁrmed CR BK Incorrect” in the online loan application and resubmitting the loan caseﬁle to DU. When the loan caseﬁle is resubmitted to DU, the bankruptcy information on the credit report will not be used.
If the lender enters “Conﬁrmed CR BK Incorrect”, the lender must document that the Chapter 13 bankruptcy was discharged two or more years or dismissed four or more years from the disbursement date of the new loan, or that the non-Chapter 13 bankruptcy was discharged or dismissed four years or more years from the disbursement date of the new loan
Underwriting when a Bankruptcy Was Due to Extenuating Circumstances
When DU identiﬁes a bankruptcy on the credit report and that bankruptcy was due to extenuating circumstances, the lender may instruct DU to disregard the bankruptcy information on the credit report in the eligibility assessment. This is done by entering “Conﬁrmed CR BK EC” in the online loan application and resubmitting the loan caseﬁle to DU. When the loan caseﬁle is resubmitted to DU, the bankruptcy information on the credit report will not be used.
If the lender enters “Conﬁrmed CR BK EC”, the lender must document that the bankruptcy was due to extenuating circumstances, and that the Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed two or more years from the disbursement date of the new loan, or that the non-Chapter 13 bankruptcy was discharged or
Published February 5, 2025
474
dismissed two or more years from the disbursement date of the new loan.
Foreclosure
DU applies the following guidelines to prior foreclosures:
Mortgage accounts, including ﬁrst liens, second liens, home improvement loans, HELOCs, and manufactured home loans, will be identiﬁed as a foreclosure if there is an MOP code of “8,” or a Remarks Code that indicates a foreclosure is present in the credit report data and associated to the tradeline.
If a foreclosure was reported within the seven-year period prior to the credit report date, the loan caseﬁle will receive an Ineligible recommendation and will be ineligible for delivery to Fannie Mae.
If the ﬁled date and the satisﬁed date of the foreclosure are both unknown, but it appears that the foreclosure occurred within the seven-year period prior to the credit report date, the lender must conﬁrm that the foreclosure did not occur within the most recent seven-year period.
Foreclosure laws vary by state and the time it takes to complete the process may vary by state. DU assumes that the date the foreclosure was reported in the tradeline is the date of the foreclosure sale or liquidation. The lender must conﬁrm that all foreclosures are satisﬁed.
Mortgage accounts that are identiﬁed as a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or preforeclosure sale will not be identiﬁed as a foreclosure.
Underwriting when Inaccurate Foreclosure Information Exists
When DU identiﬁes a foreclosure on a credit report tradeline and the foreclosure information on that tradeline is inaccurate, the lender may instruct DU to disregard the foreclosure information on the credit report in the eligibility assessment. This is done by entering “Conﬁrmed CR FC Incorrect” in the online loan application and resubmitting the loan caseﬁle to DU. When the loan caseﬁle is resubmitted to DU, the foreclosure information on the credit report tradeline will not be used in the eligibility assessment.
If the lender enters “Conﬁrmed CR FC Incorrect,” the lender must then document the foreclosure was completed seven or more years from the disbursement date of the new loan, or that the account was not subject to foreclosure and the loan complies with all other applicable requirements.
Underwriting when Extenuating Circumstances Exist
When DU identiﬁes a foreclosure on a credit report tradeline and that foreclosure was due to extenuating circumstances, the lender may instruct DU to disregard the foreclosure information on the credit report in the eligibility assessment. This is done by entering “Conﬁrmed CR FC EC” in the online loan application and resubmitting the loan caseﬁle to DU. When the loan caseﬁle is resubmitted to DU, the foreclosure information on the credit report tradeline will not be used in the eligibility assessment.
If the lender enters “Conﬁrmed CR FC EC,” the lender must then document that the foreclosure was due to extenuating circumstances, the foreclosure was completed three or more years from the disbursement date of the new loan, and the loan complies with all other requirements speciﬁc to a foreclosure due to extenuating circumstances.
Deed-in-Lieu of Foreclosure
Published February 5, 2025
475
DU applies the following guidelines to prior DILs:
DU will determine if a mortgage tradeline is a DIL by using speciﬁc Remarks Codes that are present in the credit report data and associated to the tradeline.
When DU identiﬁes a DIL, the lender must document that the event was completed four or more years from the disbursement date of the new loan, or two or more years from the disbursement date of the new loan when the lender conﬁrms that the mortgage loan meets the applicable time frames and eligibility requirements for a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure due to extenuating circumstances.
Preforeclosure Sales or Short Sales
DU will determine if a mortgage tradeline is a PFS by using speciﬁc Remarks Codes that are present in the credit report data and associated to the tradeline.
When DU identiﬁes a PFS, the lender must document that the event was completed four or more years from the disbursement date of the new loan, or two or more years from the disbursement date of the new loan when the lender conﬁrms that the mortgage loan meets the applicable time frames and eligibility requirements for a preforeclosure sale due to extenuating circumstances.
Charge-Oﬀ of Mortgage Accounts
Mortgage accounts, including ﬁrst liens, second liens, home improvements loans, HELOCs, and manufactured home loans, will be identiﬁed as a charge-oﬀ if there is an MOP code of “9” (collection or charge-oﬀ) and there is no information indicating the account may also be subject to a foreclosure (MOP code “8” or foreclosure Remarks Code), a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure (DIL Remarks Code), or a preforeclosure sale (PFS Remarks Code).
When DU identiﬁes a charge-oﬀ on a mortgage tradeline, the lender must document that the event was completed four or more years from the disbursement date of the new loan, or two or more years from the disbursement date of the new loan when the lender conﬁrms that the mortgage loan meets the applicable time frames and eligibility requirements for a charge-oﬀ due to extenuating circumstances.

Section B3-5.4, Nontraditional Credit History
B3-5.4-01, Eligibility Requirements for Loans with Nontraditional
Credit (02/05/2025)
Introduction This topic contains information on nontraditional credit eligibility requirements, including:
Overview Unacceptable Uses Manual Underwriting: At Least One Borrower Has No Credit Score DU Loan Caseﬁles: No Borrower Has a Credit Score DU Loan Caseﬁles: At Least One Borrower Has No Credit Score and Another Borrower Has a Credit Score Homeownership Education
Overview
If one or more borrowers do not have a credit score due to insuﬃcient credit, the lender must establish an acceptable nontraditional credit history. The lender must ﬁrst check all three major credit repositories to verify the borrower’s credit history and conﬁrm that the borrower does not have a credit score.
If the borrower’s credit information is frozen at one of the credit repositories, and no credit score is available from any other repository, the lender may underwrite the borrower following the requirements for nontraditional credit. If the borrower’s credit information is frozen at two or more of the credit repositories, the loan is not eligible as nontraditional credit even though no credit score is available.
The credit report will indicate if a credit score could not be produced due to insuﬃcient credit. Lenders must ensure that the credit report accurately reﬂects the borrower’s information, such as the name, Social Security number, and current residence of the borrower to conﬁrm that the lack of traditional credit was not erroneously reported because incorrect information was used to order the credit report.
Note: For certain loan transactions, one or more borrower(s) are required to have traditional credit as evidenced by a credit score. See below for additional information.
Unacceptable Uses
The establishment of a nontraditional credit history is not acceptable for the following scenarios:
The lender is able to obtain a credit score for the borrower despite the borrower’s limited use of credit.
Published February 5, 2025
477
The borrower has a suﬃcient amount of credit to obtain a credit score and the representative credit score is less than the minimum required.
Note: An exception is permitted for certain HomeReady loans for borrowers with low credit scores. See B5-6-02, HomeReady Mortgage Underwriting Methods and Requirements, for additional information.
The borrower’s traditional credit history indicates signiﬁcant derogatory references, such as a prior bankruptcy or foreclosure. In these cases, the borrower must have re-established credit in accordance with B3-5.3-07, Signiﬁcant Derogatory Credit Events — Waiting Periods and Re-establishing Credit, including the establishment of traditional credit and a credit score.
Manual Underwriting: At Least One Borrower Has No Credit Score
If one or more borrowers on the loan does not have a credit score and is relying on nontraditional credit to qualify, the following requirements apply:
The property must be a one-unit, principal residence.
Non-occupant co-borrowers are permitted, provided the requirements described in B2-2-04, Guarantors, Co-Signers, or Non-Occupant Borrowers on the Subject Transaction, are met in addition to the eligibility requirements described herein.
The transaction must be a purchase or limited cash-out reﬁnance.
The loan amount must meet the baseline loan limits—high-balance mortgage loans are not eligible.
The maximum debt-to-income ratio is 36%.
There is no minimum reserve requirement if at least one borrower can document a housing payment history as one nontraditional credit reference. Otherwise, a minimum of 12 months reserves is required. See B3-5.4-02, Number and Types of Nontraditional Credit References, for additional information.
A nontraditional credit history must be documented for each borrower without a credit score. See B3-5.4-03, Documentation and Assessment of a Nontraditional Credit History, for additional information.
DU Loan Caseﬁles: No Borrower Has a Credit Score
Lenders may submit loan caseﬁles to DU when no borrower has a credit score.
When no borrower on the loan has a credit score, but at least one borrower has a minimum of one credit account or installment account reported on their credit report, DU will assess the risk using the borrower's reported credit and the loan will be subject to standard eligibility guidelines.
When no borrower on the loan has a credit score, and no borrower has at least one credit account or installment account reported on their credit report, DU will apply the following requirements:
The property must be a one- to four-unit, principal residence, and all borrowers must occupy the property.
The transaction must be a purchase or limited cash-out reﬁnance.
Published February 5, 2025

Reserves may be required as determined by DU.
In both cases, no veriﬁcation of nontraditional credit references is required for any borrower when DU conducts a cash ﬂow assessment and issues a message that the third-party asset veriﬁcation report may be used to satisfy the requirements. Otherwise, a nontraditional credit history must be documented for each borrower without a credit score. See B3-5.4-03, Documentation and Assessment of a Nontraditional Credit History, for additional information.
If a loan caseﬁle does not receive an Approve/Eligible recommendation, it may receive a more favorable recommendation if a 12-month asset veriﬁcation report is obtained (see B3-2-03, Risk Factors Evaluated by DU). In some cases the loan may still be eligible for manual underwriting. The lender must determine whether the loan meets the requirements for a manually underwritten loan that includes a borrower without a credit score.
DU Loan Caseﬁles: At Least One Borrower Has No Credit Score and Another Borrower Has a Credit Score
Lenders may submit loan caseﬁles to DU when one (or more) borrower(s) has a credit score and at least one borrower does not have a credit score. The following documentation requirements apply:
If the borrower(s) with a credit score is contributing more than 50% of the qualifying income, the lender is not required to document a nontraditional credit history for the borrower(s) without a credit score.
If the borrower(s) with a credit score is contributing 50% or less of the qualifying income, the lender must document a nontraditional credit history for each borrower without a credit score. The lender can complete this manually or may rely on the DU message indicating that the 12-month asset veriﬁcation report satisﬁes this requirement when DU completes a cash ﬂow assessment. See B3-5.4-03, Documentation and Assessment of a Nontraditional Credit History, for additional information.
Homeownership Education
If all borrowers on the loan are relying solely on nontraditional credit to qualify, at least one borrower must complete homeownership education prior to loan closing. See B2-2-06, Homeownership Education and Housing Counseling, for the requirements.

⚬ 50% or less of qualifying income, at least two credit references for
each borrower without a credit score.
⚬ more than 50% of qualifying income, then no nontraditional credit
history is required for the borrower(s) without a credit score.
Eligible Types of Nontraditional Credit References
The types of credit references that can be used to develop a nontraditional credit history are those that require the borrower to make periodic payments on a regular basis with intervals that are no longer than every three months.
Note: There is an exception to allow a longer interval for the payment of real estate taxes on the borrower's principal residence as described below.
The lender should consider whether the borrower has any eligible housing expenses and then review other nontraditional credit references. The lender must conduct an informational interview with the borrower to identify all credit references covering the most recent consecutive 12 months. If the lender is requesting a nontraditional mortgage credit report from a consumer reporting agency, the agency will conduct the borrower interview and obtain the list of available nontraditional credit references.
In all cases, the payment history for each credit reference must be documented for the most recent consecutive 12-month period. All credit references must be included, not just those that reﬂect acceptable performance.
Acceptable Housing Payments
Loans underwritten through DU where a nontraditional credit history is required must include housing payments as one reference of nontraditional credit. Loans underwritten manually are not required to have a housing payment as one reference of nontraditional credit. However, if no borrower on the loan has a housing history, a minimum of 12 months’ reserves must be documented.
The following are examples of acceptable housing payments:
Rent: payments made to a landlord or property management company;
Privately held mortgage loan: housing payments not reported to the credit bureaus, such as contract for deed payments and other similar arrangements, provided the payments are related to the borrower's principal residence; and
Published February 5, 2025
481
Real estate taxes: payments made on the principal residence, regardless of payment frequency (for homes owned free and clear).
Other Nontraditional Credit References
In addition to a housing payment, the following other nontraditional credit references may be used to further develop additional nontraditional credit history for the borrower:
Utilities, such as electricity, gas, water, telephone service, television, and internet service providers. If utilities are included in the housing payment, they cannot be considered a separate nontraditional credit reference. Utilities can be considered a credit reference only if the payment history can be separately documented.
Medical insurance coverage (excluding payroll deductions)
Automobile insurance payments
Cell phone payments
Life insurance policies (excluding payroll deductions)
Payments for property or renter’s insurance
Payments to local stores, such as department stores, furniture stores, appliance stores
Rental (or lease) payments for durable goods, such as automobiles
Payment of medical bills
Payment of school tuition
Payments for childcare
A loan obtained from an individual, provided the repayment terms can be documented in a written agreement
Checking account, savings account, voluntary payments made to a payroll savings plan or contributions to a stock purchase plan, provided the records reﬂect an increasing balance as a result of periodic deposits over at least the most recent 12 months. Contributions must have been made no less than quarterly.
Wire remittance statements demonstrating a consistent amount of funds remitted over the most recent 12-month period.

Introduction This topic contains information on the documentation and assessment of a nontraditional credit history, including:
General Documentation Requirements Housing Payment History Standards for Individual Credit References Obtained Directly from a Creditor Standards for Documenting a Nontraditional Payment History Obtained From the Borrower Veriﬁcation of Bank Accounts and Wire Remittance Statements Borrowers with Disabilities Non-U.S. Citizen and Foreign Borrowers Assessment of the Payment History for Nontraditional Credit References
General Documentation Requirements
The lender can document the borrower’s nontraditional credit history directly from the borrower or the creditor, or by obtaining a nontraditional mortgage credit report from a consumer reporting agency.
Housing Payment History
The borrower’s housing payment history must be documented for the most recent consecutive 12-month period. The following documentation is acceptable:
Canceled checks can be provided. In lieu of canceled checks, the lender may use the borrower’s bank statements, copies of money orders, or other reasonable methods for documenting timely housing payments. The documentation must clearly indicate the payee and amount being paid, and reﬂect that payments were made on a consistent basis.
Direct veriﬁcation of the payment of rent from the landlord. Direct landlord veriﬁcation is acceptable whether the landlord is an individual or a professional management company.
If at least one borrower on the loan can document a housing payment as a nontraditional credit reference, the loan has met the housing payment history requirement. The lender is not required to obtain documentation of a housing payment history for other nontraditional credit borrowers on the loan. However, the lender must still document the minimum number of nontraditional credit references required for each nontraditional credit borrower.
If two or more borrowers on a loan share the housing-related reference (for example, they are both named on the lease for the property in which they are living), that documentation counts as one nontraditional credit reference for each borrower, even if only one borrower has been making the payments.
Published February 5, 2025
483
Note: If the credit report contains a housing payment reference and it includes the required information, including payment history, then the lender may use that housing payment reference as an acceptable nontraditional credit reference.
For examples of acceptable housing payments to fulﬁll this housing payment history requirement, see B3-5.4-02, Number and Types of Nontraditional Credit References.
Standards for Individual Credit References Obtained Directly from a Creditor
Individual credit references (other than housing payments) from a creditor must include the following:
the creditor’s name,
the name of the individual providing the reference,
the date the account was opened,
the amount of highest credit,
the current status of the account,
the required payment amount,
the unpaid balance, and
the payment history.
The historical status of each account must be stated in a “number of times past due” format using “0 X 30, 0 X 60, 0 X 90” days late.
Note: Vague statements such as “current,” “satisfactory,” or “pays as agreed” are not acceptable by themselves.
Standards for Documenting a Nontraditional Payment History Obtained From the Borrower
For documentation obtained directly from the borrower, the following standards must be met:
documentation that describes the terms of the debt repayment or contract together with canceled checks or copies of bills marked “paid” that reﬂect the borrower’s payment history over the most recent consecutive 12 months.
withdrawals or debits on the borrower’s bank statements that show the payee information clearly listed for the creditor and that payments were made on a consistent basis over the most recent consecutive 12 months.
Veriﬁcation of Bank Accounts and Wire Remittance Statements
Account statements can be used to document a nontraditional credit history, provided they are from the borrower’s checking account, savings account, voluntary payments made to a payroll savings plan, or
Published February 5, 2025
484
contributions to a stock purchase plan. The account statements must reﬂect an increasing balance as a result of periodic deposits over at least the most recent consecutive 12-month period, with contributions being made no less than quarterly. If the account statements demonstrate overdraft activity, that information suggests a weakness in the borrower’s ability to meet ﬁnancial obligations. The lender must assess the signiﬁcance of this information relative to the borrower’s overall credit risk.
Note: If the loan is underwritten by DU and a cash ﬂow assessment is conducted using a third-party asset veriﬁcation report, diﬀerent requirements may apply (see B3-2-03, Risk Factors Evaluated by DU).
Wire remittance statements can be used to document a nontraditional credit history, provided they demonstrate a consistent amount of funds being remitted over the most recent consecutive 12-month period.
Borrowers with Disabilities
If a borrower with disabilities does not have a credit score and a nontraditional credit history is being developed, the lender may use documentation provided by a court-appointed guardian, a Social Security Administration representative payee, or a parent, provided that this party:
manages the borrower’s ﬁnancial transactions,
maintains records on the borrower’s behalf, and
uses credit accounts held jointly in the name of the person with disabilities to pay ﬁnancial obligations.
The lender can use the documentation provided either to request a nontraditional mortgage credit report from a consumer reporting agency, or to establish a nontraditional credit history for the borrower, as described in this topic.
Non-U.S. Citizen and Foreign Borrowers
If a non-U.S. citizen or foreign borrower lacks suﬃcient credit references in the United States to satisfy Fannie Mae requirements, the lender must use credit references from foreign countries to achieve the required number of nontraditional credit references and establish a nontraditional credit proﬁle.
Assessment of the Payment History for Nontraditional Credit References
For each nontraditional credit reference, the following requirements must be met:
There cannot be any delinquency on housing payments within the past 12 months.
Only one account, excluding housing payments, can have a 30-day delinquency in the past 12 months.
No collections (other than medical collections) or judgments have been ﬁled in the past 24 months.
Judgments, liens, collections, and charge-oﬀs of non-mortgage accounts must be satisﬁed in accordance with B3-6-07, Debts Paid Oﬀ At or Prior to Closing (for manually underwritten loans), or B3-5.3-09, DU Credit Report Analysis (for loans underwritten with DU).
Published February 5, 2025

Note: A borrower may lack suﬃcient credit to obtain a credit score. However, the lender must still consider any derogatory credit references that appear on the credit report.

General Information on Liabilities Monthly Obligations Not Included in Liabilities
General Information on Liabilities
The lender’s risk analysis must include all liabilities aﬀecting income or assets that will aﬀect the borrower’s ability to fulﬁll the mortgage payment obligation.
A borrower’s liabilities include the following:
housing payment (mortgage or rent) for each borrower’s principal residence,
all revolving charge accounts,
Published February 5, 2025
486
installment loan debts with a remaining payment term greater than 10 months,
installment debts secured by virtual currency,
lease payments,
real estate loans,
HELOCs,
alimony and child support,
maintenance payments, and
all other debts of a recurring nature.
For each liability, the lender must determine the unpaid balance, the terms of repayment, and the borrower’s payment history, and verify any other liability that is not shown on a credit report by obtaining documentation from the borrower or creditor.
If the credit report does not contain a reference for each signiﬁcant open debt shown on the loan application—including outstanding mortgage debt, bank, student, or credit union loans—the lender must provide separate credit veriﬁcation.
If a current liability appears on the credit report that is not shown on the loan application, the borrower should provide a reasonable explanation for the undisclosed debt. Documentation may be required to support the borrower’s explanation.
If the borrower discloses, or the lender discovers, additional liabilities after the underwriting decision has been made, up to and concurrent with closing, the lender must recalculate the borrower's debt-to-income ratio.
See B3-6-02, Debt-to-Income Ratios and B3-6-03, Monthly Housing Expense for the Subject Property for additional information.
Monthly Obligations Not Included in Liabilities
Some obligations, often identiﬁed on a borrower’s paystub, are not considered a liability and will not be included as a debt or deducted from the borrower’s gross income when calculating the borrower’s debt-to-income ratio. These obligations include items such as
federal, state, and local taxes;
Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) or other retirement contributions, such as 401(k) accounts (including repayment of debt secured by these funds);
commuting costs;
union dues; and
voluntary deductions.

B3-6-02, Debt-to-Income Ratios (05/04/2022)
Introduction This topic contains information on the use of the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, including:
DTI Ratios Maximum DTI Ratios Exceptions to the Maximum DTI Ratio Calculating Total Monthly Obligation DTI Ratio Tolerance and Re-Underwriting Criteria Applying the Re-underwriting Criteria
DTI Ratios
The DTI ratio consists of two components:
total monthly obligations, which includes the qualifying payment for the subject mortgage loan and other long-term and signiﬁcant short-term monthly debts (see Calculating Total Monthly Obligation below); and
total monthly income of all borrowers, to the extent the income is used to qualify for the mortgage (see Chapter B3–3, Income Assessment).
Maximum DTI Ratios
For manually underwritten loans, Fannie Mae’s maximum total DTI ratio is 36% of the borrower’s stable monthly income. The maximum can be exceeded up to 45% if the borrower meets the credit score and reserve requirements reﬂected in the Eligibility Matrix.
For loan caseﬁles underwritten through DU, the maximum allowable DTI ratio is 50%.
See B3-1-01, Comprehensive Risk Assessment for information about the DTI.
Published February 5, 2025
488
Exceptions to the Maximum DTI Ratio
Fannie Mae makes exceptions to the maximum allowable DTI ratios for particular mortgage transactions, including:
cash-out reﬁnance transactions — the maximum ratio may be lower for loan caseﬁles underwritten through DU (see B2-1.3-03, Cash-Out Reﬁnance Transactions);
high LTV reﬁnance transactions - except for loans underwritten under the Alternative Qualiﬁcation Path, there are no maximum DTI ratio requirements (see B5-7-01, High LTV Reﬁnance Loan and Borrower Eligibility);
borrowers who do not have a credit score — the maximum ratio may be lower for manually underwritten loans and DU loan caseﬁles (see B3-5.4-01, Eligibility Requirements for Loans with Nontraditional Credit);
non-occupant borrowers — the maximum ratio is lower than 45% for the occupying borrower for manually underwritten loans (see B2-2-04, Guarantors, Co-Signers, or Non-Occupant Borrowers on the Subject Transaction); and
government mortgage loans — lenders must follow the requirements for the respective government agency.
Calculating Total Monthly Obligation
The total monthly obligation is the sum of the following:
the housing payment for each borrower’s principal residence
if the subject loan is the borrower’s principal residence, use the PITIA and qualifying payment amount (see B3-6-03, Monthly Housing Expense for the Subject Property);
if there is a non-occupant borrower, use the mortgage payment (including HOA fees and subordinate lien payments) or rental payments (see B3-6-05, Monthly Debt Obligations);
if the subject loan is a second home or investment property, use the mortgage payment (including HOA fees and subordinate lien payments) or rental payments (see B3-6-05, Monthly Debt Obligations;
the qualifying payment amount if the subject loan is for a second home or investment property (see B3-6-04, Qualifying Payment Requirements);
monthly payments on installment debts and other mortgage debts that extend beyond ten months;
monthly payments on installment debts and other mortgage debts that extend ten months or less if the payments signiﬁcantly aﬀect the borrower’s ability to meet credit obligations;
monthly payments on installment debts secured by virtual currency;
monthly payments on revolving debts;
monthly payments on lease agreements, regardless of the expiration date of the lease;
monthly alimony, child support, or maintenance payments that extend beyond ten months (alimony (but not child support or maintenance) may instead be deducted from income, (see B3-6-05, Monthly Debt Obligations);
Published February 5, 2025
489
monthly payments for other recurring monthly obligations; and
any net loss from a rental property.
Note: Fannie Mae acknowledges that lenders may sometimes apply a more conservative approach when qualifying borrowers. This is acceptable as long as Fannie Mae’s minimum requirements are met, and lenders consistently apply the same approach to similar loans. For example, a lender might calculate a higher minimum payment on a credit card account than what Fannie Mae requires, which is acceptable as long as the lender consistently applies this calculation to all mortgage applications with revolving debts.
DTI Ratio Tolerance and Re-Underwriting Criteria
Fannie Mae expects lenders to have in place processes to facilitate borrower disclosure of changes in ﬁnancial circumstances throughout the origination process and prefunding quality control processes to increase the likelihood of discovering material undisclosed debts or reduced income. See D1-2-01, Lender Prefunding Quality Control Review Process.
As a result of the lender's normal processes and controls, the lender may need to re-underwrite the loan after initial underwriting. If the borrower discloses or the lender discovers additional debt(s) or reduced income after the underwriting decision was made up to and concurrent with loan closing, the loan must be re-underwritten if the new information causes the DTI ratio to increase by more than the allowed tolerances.
In all cases, if the lender determines that there is new subordinate ﬁnancing on the subject property during the loan process, the mortgage loan must be re-underwritten.
Note: Re-underwriting means that loan caseﬁles must be resubmitted to DU with updated information; and for manually underwritten loans, a comprehensive risk and eligibility assessment must be performed.
Applying the Re-underwriting Criteria
The following steps are required if the borrower discloses or the lender discovers additional debt(s) or reduced income after the underwriting decision was made up to and concurrent with loan closing:
Step
Description
1
The lender must document the additional debt(s) and reduced income in accordance with
B3-6-01, General Information on Liabilities or B3-3, Income Assessment, as applicable.
Note: The lender is not required to obtain a new credit report to verify the additional debt(s).
However, if the lender chooses to obtain a new credit report after the initial underwriting decision
was made, the loan must be re-underwritten.
2
If there is new subordinate debt on the subject property, the mortgage loan must be re-
underwritten.
Published February 5, 2025
490
Step
Description
3
The lender must recalculate the DTI ratio. For DU loan caseﬁles, the DTI ratio should be
recalculated outside of DU.
If the recalculated DTI ratio exceeds 45% for a manually underwritten loan or 50% for a DU loan
caseﬁle, the loan is not eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae.
Manually underwritten loans: If the recalculated DTI does not exceed 45%, the mortgage loan
must be re-underwritten with the updated information to determine if the loan is still eligible for
delivery. Note: If the increase in the DTI ratio moves the DTI ratio above the 36% threshold, the
loan must meet the credit score and reserve requirements in the Eligibility Matrix that apply to
DTI ratios greater than 36% up to 45%.

DU loan caseﬁles: See B3-2-10, Accuracy of DU Data, DU Tolerances, and Errors in the Credit
Report for the tolerances and resubmission requirements associated with changes impacting the
DTI.
High LTV reﬁnance loans: For loans underwritten in accordance with the Alternative
Qualiﬁcation Path, if the recalculated DTI ratio exceeds 45%, the loan is not eligible for delivery to
Fannie Mae. If the DTI does not exceed 45%, but is increasing by 3 or more percentage points,
the loan must be re-underwritten with the updated information to determine if the loan is still
eligible for delivery.

The ﬁnal loan application signed by the borrower must include all income and debts veriﬁed,
disclosed, or identiﬁed during the mortgage process.

B3-6-03, Monthly Housing Expense for the Subject Property
(12/16/2020)
Introduction This topic contains information about the following:
Monthly Housing Expense Calculating Monthly Real Estate Tax Payment
Monthly Housing Expense
Monthly housing expense is the sum of the following and is referred to as PITIA for the subject property:
principal and interest (P&I);
property, ﬂood, and mortgage insurance premiums (as applicable);
real estate taxes;
ground rent;
special assessments;
any owners’ association dues (including utility charges that are attributable to the common areas, but excluding any utility charges that apply to the individual unit);
any monthly co-op corporation fee (less the pro rata share of the master utility charges for servicing individual units that is attributable to the borrower’s unit);
any subordinate ﬁnancing payments on mortgages secured by the subject property.
Note: The monthly payment of a subordinate lien associated with a business debt secured by the subject property can be excluded from the monthly housing expense if it meets the requirements of Business Debt in the Borrower’s Name in B3-6-05, Monthly Debt Obligations.
Lenders must enter all components of the monthly housing expense on the loan application including subordinate ﬁnancing P&I, homeowner’s insurance, supplemental property insurance, real estate taxes, mortgage insurance, association/project dues, and other proposed housing expenses.
Published February 5, 2025
492
If the subject mortgage is secured by the borrower's principal residence, the monthly housing expense is based on the qualifying payment required in accordance with B3-6-04, Qualifying Payment Requirements. This amount is the monthly housing expense used to calculate the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.
If the subject mortgage is secured by a second home or an investment property, the qualifying payment amount is considered one of the borrower's monthly debt obligations when calculating the DTI ratio.
Calculating Monthly Real Estate Tax Payment
The lender must base its calculation of real estate taxes for borrower qualiﬁcation on no less than the current assessed value. However, the lender must project the real estate taxes if one of the following applies:
For purchase and construction-related transactions, the lender must use a reasonable estimate of the real estate taxes based on the value of the land and the total of all new and existing improvements. This policy also applies to properties in jurisdictions where a transfer of ownership typically results in a reassessment or revaluation of the property and a corresponding increase in the amount of taxes.
There is a tax abatement on the subject property that will last for no less than 5 years from the note date. For example:
for a municipality with a 10-year abatement, the lender may qualify the borrower with the reduced tax amount;
for a municipality with a 10-year abatement and with annual real estate tax increases in years 1 through 10, the lender must qualify the borrower with the annual taxes that will be required at the
end of the 5th year after the ﬁrst mortgage payment date.
The lender has the option to project the real estate taxes if the amount of taxes will be reduced based on federal, state, or local jurisdictional requirements. However, the taxes may not be reduced if an appeal to reduce them is only pending and has not been approved.

Qualifying Payment Amount Additional Information About ARM Qualifying for DU Loan Caseﬁles
Qualifying Payment Amount
The calculation of the qualifying payment amount for the subject property will diﬀer based on the transaction type (as shown in the following table). For all loans, the qualifying rate is based on the original loan amount and the loan amortization term.
These policies apply to both manually underwritten loans and DU loan caseﬁles. In all cases, qualiﬁcation must consider the borrower's current obligations and other mortgage-related obligations, e.g. PITIA.
Loans subject to temporary interest rate buydowns must be qualiﬁed without consideration of the bought-down rate, based on the transaction type below.

B3-6-05, Monthly Debt Obligations (05/04/2022)
Introduction This topic describes obligations that should be considered in underwriting the loan, including:
Alimony, Child Support, and Separate Maintenance Payments Bridge / Swing Loans Business Debt in Borrower’s Name Court-Ordered Assignment of Debt Debts Paid by Others Non-Applicant Accounts Deferred Installment Debt Federal Income Tax Installment Agreements Garnishments Home Equity Lines of Credit Installment Debt Lease Payments Rental Housing Payment Loans Secured by Financial Assets Open 30–Day Charge Accounts Other Real Estate Owned—Qualifying Impact Revolving Charge/Lines of Credit Student Loans
Alimony, Child Support, and Separate Maintenance Payments
When the borrower is required to pay alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments under a divorce decree, separation agreement, or any other written legal agreement—and those payments must continue to be made for more than ten months—the payments must be considered as part of the borrower’s recurring monthly debt obligations. However, voluntary payments do not need to be taken into consideration and an exception is allowed for alimony. A copy of the divorce decree, separation agreement, court order, or equivalent documentation conﬁrming the amount of the obligation must be obtained and retained in the loan ﬁle.
For alimony and separate maintenance obligations, the lender has the option to reduce the qualifying income by the amount of the obligation in lieu of including it as a monthly payment in the calculation of the DTI ratio.
Published February 5, 2025
496
Note: For loan caseﬁles underwritten through DU, when using the option of reducing the borrower’s monthly qualifying income by the alimony or separate maintenance payment, the lender must enter the amount of the monthly obligation as a negative alimony or separate maintenance income amount. (If the borrower also receives alimony or separate maintenance income, the amounts should be combined and entered as a net amount.)
Bridge / Swing Loans
When a borrower obtains a bridge (or swing) loan, the funds from that loan can be used for closing on a new principal residence before the current residence is sold. This creates a contingent liability that must be considered part of the borrower’s recurring monthly debt obligations and included in the DTI ratio calculation.
Fannie Mae will waive this requirement and not require the debt to be included in the DTI ratio if the following documentation is provided:
a fully executed sales contract for the current residence, and
conﬁrmation that any ﬁnancing contingencies have been cleared.
Business Debt in Borrower’s Name
When a self-employed borrower claims that a monthly obligation that appears on their personal credit report (such as a Small Business Administration loan) is being paid by the borrower’s business, the lender must conﬁrm that it veriﬁed that the obligation was actually paid out of company funds and that this was considered in its cash ﬂow analysis of the borrower’s business.
The account payment does not need to be considered as part of the borrower’s DTI ratio if:
the account in question does not have a history of delinquency,
the business provides acceptable evidence that the obligation was paid out of company funds (such as 12 months of canceled company checks), and
the lender’s cash ﬂow analysis of the business took payment of the obligation into consideration.
The account payment must be considered as part of the borrower’s DTI ratio in any of the following situations:
If the business does not provide suﬃcient evidence that the obligation was paid out of company funds.
If the business provides acceptable evidence of its payment of the obligation, but the lender’s cash ﬂow analysis of the business does not reﬂect any business expense related to the obligation (such as an interest expense—and taxes and insurance, if applicable—equal to or greater than the amount of interest that one would reasonably expect to see given the amount of ﬁnancing shown on the credit report and the age of the loan). It is reasonable to assume that the obligation has not been accounted for in the cash ﬂow analysis.
If the account in question has a history of delinquency. To ensure that the obligation is counted only once, the lender should adjust the net income of the business by the amount of interest, taxes, or insurance expense, if any, that relates to the account in question.

Court-Ordered Assignment of Debt
When a borrower has outstanding debt that was assigned to another party by court order (such as under a divorce decree or separation agreement) and the creditor does not release the borrower from liability, the borrower has a contingent liability. The lender is not required to count this contingent liability as part of the borrower’s recurring monthly debt obligations.
The lender is not required to evaluate the payment history for the assigned debt after the eﬀective date of the assignment. The lender cannot disregard the borrower’s payment history for the debt before its assignment.
Debts Paid by Others
Certain debts can be excluded from the borrower’s recurring monthly obligations and the DTI ratio:
When a borrower is obligated on a non-mortgage debt - but is not the party who is actually repaying the debt - the lender may exclude the monthly payment from the borrower's recurring monthly obligations. This policy applies whether or not the other party is obligated on the debt, but is not applicable if the other party is an interested party to the subject transaction (such as the seller or real estate agent). Non- mortgage debts include installment loans, student loans, revolving accounts, lease payments, alimony, child support, and separate maintenance. See below for treatment of payments due under a federal income tax installment agreement.
When a borrower is obligated on a mortgage debt - but is not the party who is actually repaying the debt - the lender may exclude the full monthly housing expense (PITIA) from the borrower’s recurring monthly obligations if
the party making the payments is obligated on the mortgage debt,
there are no delinquencies in the most recent 12 months, and
the borrower is not using rental income from the applicable property to qualify.
In order to exclude non-mortgage or mortgage debts from the borrower’s DTI ratio, the lender must obtain the most recent 12 months' canceled checks (or bank statements) from the other party making the payments that document a 12-month payment history with no delinquent payments.
When a borrower is obligated on a mortgage debt, regardless of whether or not the other party is making the monthly mortgage payments, the referenced property must be included in the count of ﬁnanced properties (if applicable per B2-2-03, Multiple Financed Properties for the Same Borrower.
Non-Applicant Accounts
Credit reports may include accounts identiﬁed as possible non-applicant accounts (or with other similar notation). Non-applicant accounts may belong to the borrower, or they may truly belong to another individual.
Typical causes of non-applicant accounts include:
applicants who are Juniors or Seniors,
Published February 5, 2025
498
individuals who move frequently,
unrelated individuals who have identical names, and
debts the borrower applied for under a diﬀerent Social Security number or under a diﬀerent address. These may be indicative of potential fraud.
If the debts do not belong to the borrower, the lender may provide supporting documentation to validate this, and may exclude the non-applicant debts for the borrower’s DTI ratio. If the debts do belong to the borrower, they must be included as part of the borrower’s recurring monthly debt obligations.
Deferred Installment Debt
Deferred installment debts must be included as part of the borrower’s recurring monthly debt obligations. For deferred installment debts other than student loans, if the borrower’s credit report does not indicate the monthly amount that will be payable at the end of the deferment period, the lender must obtain copies of the borrower’s payment letters or forbearance agreements so that a monthly payment amount can be determined and used in calculating the borrower’s total monthly obligations.
For information about deferred student loans, see Student Loans below.
Federal Income Tax Installment Agreements
When a borrower has entered into an installment agreement with the IRS to repay delinquent federal income taxes, the lender may include the monthly payment amount as part of the borrower’s monthly debt obligations (in lieu of requiring payment in full) if:
There is no indication that a Notice of Federal Tax Lien has been ﬁled against the borrower in the county in which the subject property is located.
The lender obtains the following documentation:
an approved IRS installment agreement with the terms of repayment, including the monthly payment amount and total amount due; and
evidence the borrower is current on the payments associated with the tax installment plan. Acceptable evidence includes the most recent payment reminder from the IRS, reﬂecting the last payment amount and date and the next payment amount owed and due date. At least one payment must have been made prior to closing.
As a reminder, lenders remain responsible under the life-of-loan representations and warranties for clear title and ﬁrst-lien enforceability in accordance with A2-2-07, Life-of-Loan Representations and Warranties.
The payments on a federal income tax installment agreement can be excluded from the borrower’s DTI ratio if the agreement meets the terms in Debts Paid by Others or Installment Debt described above. If any of the above conditions are not met, the borrower must pay oﬀ the outstanding balance due under the installment agreement with the IRS in accordance with B3-6-07, Debts Paid Oﬀ At or Prior to Closing
Garnishments
Published February 5, 2025
499
All garnishments with more than ten months remaining must be included in the borrower’s recurring monthly debt obligations for qualifying purposes.
Home Equity Lines of Credit
When the mortgage that will be delivered to Fannie Mae also has a home equity line of credit (HELOC) that provides for a monthly payment of principal and interest or interest only, the payment on the HELOC must be considered as part of the borrower’s recurring monthly debt obligations. If the HELOC does not require a payment, there is no recurring monthly debt obligation so the lender does not need to develop an equivalent payment amount.
Installment Debt
All installment debt that is not secured by a ﬁnancial asset—including student loans, automobile loans, personal loans, and timeshares—must be considered part of the borrower’s recurring monthly debt obligations if there are more than ten monthly payments remaining. However, an installment debt with fewer monthly payments remaining also should be considered as a recurring monthly debt obligation if it signiﬁcantly aﬀects the borrower’s ability to meet their credit obligations. See below for treatment of payments due under a federal income tax installment agreement.
Note: A timeshare account should be treated as an installment debt regardless of how it is reported on the credit report or other documentation (that is, even if reported as a mortgage loan).
Lease Payments
Lease payments must be considered as recurring monthly debt obligations regardless of the number of months remaining on the lease. This is because the expiration of a lease agreement for rental housing or an automobile typically leads to either a new lease agreement, the buyout of the existing lease, or the purchase of a new vehicle or house.
Rental Housing Payment
The housing payment for each borrower’s principal residence must be considered when underwriting the loan. For the following scenarios, the borrower’s monthly rental housing payment must be evaluated (if the borrower does not otherwise have a mortgage payment or no housing expense):
for non-occupant borrowers, and
for second homes or investment properties.
The following list provides examples of acceptable documentation to verify the rental payment:
six months canceled checks or equivalent payment source;
six months bank statements reﬂecting a clear and consistent payment to an organization or individual;
Published February 5, 2025
500
direct veriﬁcation of rent from a management company or individual landlord; or
a copy of a current, fully executed lease agreement and two months canceled checks (or equivalent payment source) supporting the rental payment amount.
Note: Refer to B3-5.4-03, Documentation and Assessment of a Nontraditional Credit History for rental payment history requirements when using non-traditional credit.
Loans Secured by Financial Assets
When a borrower uses their ﬁnancial assets—life insurance policies, 401(k) accounts, individual retirement accounts, certiﬁcates of deposit, stocks, bonds, etc.—as security for a loan, the borrower has a contingent liability.
The lender is not required to include this contingent liability as part of the borrower’s recurring monthly debt obligations provided the lender obtains a copy of the applicable loan instrument that shows the borrower’s ﬁnancial asset as collateral for the loan. If the borrower intends to use the same asset to satisfy ﬁnancial reserve requirements, the lender must reduce the value of the asset (the account balance, in most cases) by the proceeds from the secured loan and any related fees to determine whether the borrower has suﬃcient reserves.
Note: Payment on any debt secured by virtual currency is an exception to the above policy and must be included when calculating the debt-to-income ratio.
Open 30–Day Charge Accounts
Open 30–day charge accounts require the balance to be paid in full every month. Fannie Mae does not require open 30–day charge accounts to be included in the debt-to-income ratio.
See B3-6-07, Debts Paid Oﬀ At or Prior to Closing, for additional information on open 30–day charge accounts.
Other Real Estate Owned—Qualifying Impact
For details regarding the qualifying impact of other real estate owned, see B3-6-06, Qualifying Impact of Other Real Estate Owned.
Revolving Charge/Lines of Credit
Revolving charge accounts and unsecured lines of credit are open-ended and should be treated as long-term debts and must be considered part of the borrower's recurring monthly debt obligations. These tradelines include credit cards, department store charge cards, and personal lines of credit. Equity lines of credit secured by real estate should be included in the housing expense.
If the credit report does not show a required minimum payment amount and there is no supplemental documentation to support a payment of less than 5%, the lender must use 5% of the outstanding balance as the borrower's recurring monthly debt obligation.
Published February 5, 2025
501
For DU loan caseﬁles, if a revolving debt is provided on the loan application without a monthly payment amount, DU will use the greater of $10 or 5% of the outstanding balance as the monthly payment when calculating the total debt-to-income ratio.
Student Loans
If a monthly student loan payment is provided on the credit report, the lender may use that amount for qualifying purposes. If the credit report does not reﬂect the correct monthly payment, the lender may use the monthly payment that is on the student loan documentation (the most recent student loan statement) to qualify the borrower.
If the credit report does not provide a monthly payment for the student loan, or if the credit report shows $0 as the monthly payment, the lender must determine the qualifying monthly payment using one of the options below.
If the borrower is on an income-driven payment plan, the lender may obtain student loan documentation to verify the actual monthly payment is $0. The lender may then qualify the borrower with a $0 payment.
For deferred loans or loans in forbearance, the lender may calculate
a payment equal to 1% of the outstanding student loan balance (even if this amount is lower than the actual fully amortizing payment), or
a fully amortizing payment using the documented loan repayment terms.

B3-6-06, Qualifying Impact of Other Real Estate Owned (06/30/2015)
Introduction This topic describes the qualifying impact of other real estate owned, including:
Qualifying Considerations Mortgage Assumption Property Settlement Buyout Current Principal Residence Pending Sale
Qualifying Considerations
When the borrower owns mortgaged real estate, the status of the property determines how the existing property's PITIA must be considered in qualifying for the new mortgage transaction. If the mortgaged property owned by the borrower is
an existing investment property or a current principal residence converting to investment use, the borrower must be qualiﬁed in accordance with, but not limited to, the policies in topics B3-3.1-08, Rental Income, B3-4.1-01, Minimum Reserve Requirements, and, if applicable B2-2-03, Multiple Financed Properties for the Same Borrower;
an existing second home or a current principal residence converting to a second home, the PITIA of the second home must also be counted as part of the borrower's recurring monthly debt obligations; or
the borrower's current principal residence that is pending sale but will not close (with title transfer to the new owner) prior to the subject transaction, the lender must comply with the policies in this topic.
In conjunction with the policies in this topic, the lender must also comply with the policies in B2-2-03, Multiple Financed Properties for the Same Borrower, B3-3.1-08, Rental Income, and B3-4.1-01, Minimum Reserve Requirements, as applicable.
Mortgage Assumption
When a borrower sells a mortgaged property and the property purchaser assumes the outstanding mortgage debt without a release of liability, the borrower has a contingent liability.
The lender is not required to count this contingent liability (PITIA) as part of the borrower’s recurring monthly debt obligations if the lender veriﬁes that the property purchaser has at least a 12-month history of making regular, timely payments for the mortgage. The lender can document this by obtaining
evidence of the transfer of ownership;
a copy of the formal, executed assumption agreement; and
a credit report indicating that consistent and timely payments were made for the assumed mortgage.
Published February 5, 2025
503
If the lender cannot document timely payments during the most recent 12-month period, the applicable mortgage payment must be counted as part of the borrower’s recurring monthly debt obligations.
Property Settlement Buyout
When a borrower’s interest in a property is bought out by another co-owner of the property, as often happens in a divorce settlement, but the lender does not release the borrower from liability under the mortgage, the borrower has a contingent liability.
If the lender obtains documentation to conﬁrm the transfer of title to the property, this liability does not have to be considered as part of the borrower’s recurring monthly debt obligations.
Current Principal Residence Pending Sale
If the borrower's current principal residence is pending sale, but the transaction will not close with title transfer to the new owner prior to the subject transaction, and the borrower is purchasing a new principal residence, the current PITIA and the proposed PITIA must be used in qualifying the borrower for the new mortgage loan.
However, Fannie Mae will not require the current principal residence's PITIA to be used in qualifying the borrower as long as the following documentation is provided:
the executed sales contract for the current residence, and
conﬁrmation that any ﬁnancing contingencies have been cleared.

B3-6-07, Debts Paid Oﬀ At or Prior to Closing (04/05/2023)
Introduction This topic contains information on debts paid oﬀ at or prior to closing, including:
Payoﬀ or Paydown of Debt for Qualiﬁcation Open 30-Day Charge Accounts Collections, Charge-Oﬀs of Non-Mortgage Accounts, Judgments, and Liens
Payoﬀ or Paydown of Debt for Qualiﬁcation
Payoﬀ or paydown of debt solely to qualify must be carefully evaluated and considered in the overall loan analysis. The borrower’s history of credit use should be a factor in determining whether the appropriate
Published February 5, 2025
504
approach is to include or exclude debt for qualiﬁcation. Generally
Installment loans that are being paid oﬀ or paid down to 10 or fewer remaining monthly payments do not need to be included in the borrower’s long-term debt.
If a revolving account balance is to be paid oﬀ at or prior to closing, a monthly payment on the current outstanding balance does not need to be included in the borrower's long-term debt, i.e., not included in the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. Such accounts do not need to be closed as a condition of excluding the payment from the DTI ratio.
See B3-6-02, Debt-to-Income Ratios for additional guidance on calculating total monthly obligations for qualifying purposes.
Open 30-Day Charge Accounts
For open 30-day charge accounts that do not reﬂect a monthly payment on the credit report, or 30-day accounts that reﬂect a monthly payment that is identical to the account balance, lenders must verify borrower funds to cover the account balance. The veriﬁed funds must be in addition to any funds required for closing costs and reserves.
Note: DU will include the balance of the 30-day charge accounts on the loan application in the Reserves Required to be Veriﬁed amount shown on the DU Underwriting Findings report. However, for transactions that do not require the veriﬁcation of reserves, the balance of 30–day charge accounts in the Reserves Required to be Veriﬁed amount will be reduced by any cash out the borrower will receive through the transaction.
If the borrower paid oﬀ the account balance prior to closing, the lender may provide proof of payoﬀ in lieu of verifying funds to cover the account balance.
Collections, Charge-Oﬀs of Non-Mortgage Accounts, Judgments, and Liens
Delinquent credit—including taxes, judgments, charge-oﬀs of non-mortgage accounts (see below for exceptions), tax liens, mechanic's or materialmen’s liens, and liens that have the potential to aﬀect Fannie Mae’s lien position or diminish the borrower’s equity—must be paid oﬀ at or prior to closing.
Delinquent federal income taxes that are approved to be paid by a monthly installment agreement with the IRS must be paid in full at or prior to closing if there is any indication that a Notice of Federal Tax Lien has been recorded against the borrower in the county in which the subject property is located. For additional information about federal income tax installment agreements, see B3-6-05, Monthly Debt Obligations.
For details regarding delinquent federal income taxes that the IRS has approved to be paid through an installment agreement that can be included as a monthly debt obligation, rather than being paid in full, also see B3-6-05, Monthly Debt Obligations.
For manually underwritten loans, non-medical collection accounts and charge-oﬀs on non-mortgage accounts do not have to be paid oﬀ at or prior to closing if the balance of an individual account is less than $250 or the total balance of all accounts is $1,000 or less. Non-medical collection accounts and charge-oﬀs on non-mortgage accounts that exceed these limits must be paid oﬀ at or prior to closing.

B3-6-08, DU: Requirements for Liability Assessment (01/27/2015)
Introduction This topic contains information on DU requirements for liability assessment, including:
Reconciling the Loan Application with the Credit Report Auto-Populating DU Liabilities from the Credit Report
Reconciling the Loan Application with the Credit Report
DU uses liabilities from the loan application, not debts from the credit report, to calculate the debt-to-income ratio.
To help ensure that all appropriate liabilities are included in the debt-to-income ratio, DU performs a series of reasonableness tests comparing loan application balances and payments with the credit report balances and payments. If the values on the loan application are less than the values on the credit report by more than selected tolerances, the lender must justify the discrepancies between the two. The lender must update the loan application values if the values are needed to calculate accurate ratios. The information must be updated either with veriﬁed values from the credit report or with independent, outside veriﬁcations.
Auto-Populating DU Liabilities from the Credit Report
The lender can automatically copy the borrower’s liabilities from the credit report to the loan application by selecting the auto-populate liabilities option from DU when the credit report is ordered. If the lender’s loan origination system does not oﬀer this option, or if the lender elects not to use it, the liabilities must be entered manually into the loan application.
When the auto-populate option is selected, it is not necessary to obtain additional borrower disclosure for tradelines appearing on the credit report. The lender is still required to obtain full disclosure from all borrowers, including borrowers who do not have traditional credit, of all existing credit obligations. Liabilities that do not
Published February 5, 2025
506
appear on the credit report, such as monthly housing expenses for taxes, insurance, must be disclosed in the loan application prior to ﬁnal submission to DU.
If the auto-populate liabilities option is selected BEFORE liabilities have been manually entered in the loan application:
Open accounts will be automatically copied to the loan application.
Closed accounts on the credit report are not automatically copied to the loan application. If the account has an outstanding balance, the lender must manually enter the liability in the loan application and include the monthly payment in the debt-to-income ratio.
Collection accounts on the credit report are not automatically copied to the loan application.
If the auto-populate liabilities option is selected AFTER liabilities have been manually entered in the loan application:
DU will attempt to match existing liability accounts listed on the loan application to the credit report liabilities by using a combination of account name and account number.
Open accounts from the credit report that were not manually entered on the loan application will be automatically copied to the loan application.
DU will use the information on the loan application to calculate the debt-to-income ratio.
If duplicate accounts or accounts that do not belong to the borrower were copied to the loan application and included in the debt-to-income ratio, they may be omitted (or deleted) from the loan application. Debts that are omitted will not be counted in the debt-to-income ratio.

B4-1.1-01, Deﬁnition of Market Value (04/15/2014)
Introduction This topic contains information on the deﬁnition of market value.
Deﬁnition of Market Value
Deﬁnition of Market Value
Market value is the most probable price that a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller, each acting prudently, knowledgeably and assuming the price is not aﬀected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this deﬁnition is the consummation of a sale as of a speciﬁed date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby:
buyer and seller are typically motivated;
both parties are well informed or well advised, and each acting in what they consider to be in their own best interest;
a reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market;
payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of ﬁnancial arrangements comparable thereto; and
the price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaﬀected by special or creative ﬁnancing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale.
Note: Adjustments to the comparables must be made for special or creative ﬁnancing or sales concessions. No adjustments are necessary for those costs that are normally paid by sellers as a result of tradition or law in a market area; these costs are readily identiﬁable because the seller pays these costs in virtually all sales transactions. Special or creative ﬁnancing adjustments can be made to the comparable property by comparisons to ﬁnancing terms oﬀered by a third-party institutional lender that is not already involved in the property or transaction. Any adjustment should not be calculated on a mechanical dollar for dollar cost of the ﬁnancing or concession, but the dollar amount of any adjustment should approximate the market’s reaction to the ﬁnancing or concessions based on the appraiser’s judgment.

B4-1.1-02, Lender Responsibilities (11/06/2024)
Introduction This topic contains information on lender requirements, including:
Lender Responsibilities Conﬁrmation and Documentation of the Current Owner Objective and Unbiased Appraisals Reporting Unfavorable Conditions
Lender Responsibilities
The lender is responsible for ensuring that the subject property provides adequate collateral for the mortgage. For most loans, Fannie Mae requires that the lender obtain a signed and complete appraisal report that accurately reﬂects the market value, condition, and marketability of the property. Some loans may be eligible for a value acceptance option, and an appraisal is not required if the lender exercises the option and complies with the related requirements. (See B4-1.4-10, Value Acceptance (Appraisal Waiver) and B4-1.4-11, Value Acceptance + Property Data, for additional information.)
If an appraisal is obtained, the lender is responsible for
providing the borrower disclosures and requirements described in B4-1.3-12, Appraisal Quality Matters;
compliance with the Appraiser Independence Requirements;
selection of the appraiser (see B4-1.1-03, Appraiser Selection Criteria);
compliance with the Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) when applicable (see B4-1.1-06, Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) and the Uniform Collateral Data Portal (UCDP));
ensuring the appraiser has utilized sound reasoning and provided evidence to support the methodology chosen to develop the value opinion, particularly in cases that are not covered by Fannie Mae policy;
successful submission of the appraisal through the UCDP prior to delivery (see B4-1.1-06, Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) and the Uniform Collateral Data Portal (UCDP));
continually evaluating the appraiser’s work through the quality control process (see B4-1.3-12, Appraisal Quality Matters and D1-3-04, Lender Post-Closing Quality Control Review of Appraisers, Appraisals, Property Data Collectors, and Property Data Collection); and
ensuring the appraisal does not contain subjective and prohibited language relating to discriminatory practices and appraisal bias.
If the transaction involves property data collection, the lender is responsible for
compliance with the Property Data Collector Independence Requirements; selection of the property data collector (see B4-1.4-11, Value Acceptance + Property Data); successful submission of the data to Fannie Mae's Property Data API prior to loan delivery; and continually evaluating the property data collector's work through the quality control process (see
Published February 5, 2025
509
D1-3-04, Lender Post-Closing Quality Control Review of Appraisers, Appraisals, Property Data Collectors, and Property Data Collection).
Conﬁrmation and Documentation of the Current Owner
Publicly available information helps to identify property ﬂipping schemes, which typically involve various combinations of transactions and result in a sale of recently acquired property for signiﬁcant proﬁt based on a misleading or fraudulent appraisal with an inﬂated property value. The lender must conﬁrm that the property seller in a purchase transaction (or the borrower in a reﬁnance transaction) is the owner of the subject property.
Lenders must conﬁrm and document in the mortgage ﬁle that the property seller in a purchase money transaction or the borrower in a reﬁnance transaction is the owner of the subject property when an appraisal is required. Examples of acceptable documentation include, but are not limited to:
a copy of a recorded deed, mortgage, or deed of trust,
a recent property tax bill or tax assessment notice,
a title report,
a title commitment or binder, or
a property sale history report.
This documentation is especially important for transactions involving an assignment (or sale) of a contract for sale and back-to-back, simultaneous, double transaction closings, or double escrows to support the property acquisition, ﬁnancing, and closing.
When the transaction is part of an employee relocation, the relocation company may be the assignee of the seller, which should be indicated on the sales contract. Additionally, the appraiser must comment on this condition in the appraisal report.
Objective and Unbiased Appraisals
A lender must ensure the appraiser
described the property and the market area in factual, unbiased, and speciﬁc terms;
considered all factors that have an eﬀect on value; and
was objective and unbiased in the development of the opinion of market value in the appraisal report.
A number of federal, state, and local laws prohibit discrimination in the appraisal of housing. Fannie Mae expects professional appraisers to fully understand that discriminatory valuation and appraisal reporting practices are not only illegal, but also unethical. Unintentional discrimination can occur in the appraisal report as the result of what an appraiser states, or fails to state. The lender and appraiser must ensure the appraisal is not in violation of any unacceptable appraisal practices (see B4-1.1-04, Unacceptable Appraisal Practices).
Reporting Unfavorable Conditions
Published February 5, 2025
510
The lender must ensure that appraiser comments regarding unfavorable conditions, such as the existence of an adverse environmental or economic factor, also discuss how the condition aﬀects the value or marketability of the property being appraised and explain how the condition was taken into consideration in the valuation process. In such cases, the appraiser’s analysis must reﬂect and include comparable sales that are similarly aﬀected whenever possible. The appraiser must address the impact these factors may have, if any, on the value and marketability of the subject property. (See B4-1.3-06, Property Condition and Quality of Construction of the Improvements, for further information).

B4-1.1-03, Appraiser Selection Criteria (10/05/2022)
Introduction This topic contains general information on appraiser selection, including:
Appraiser License and Certiﬁcation Appraiser Trainees Knowledge and Experience Selection of the Appraiser Supervisory Appraiser
Published February 5, 2025
511
Appraiser License and Certiﬁcation
Fannie Mae requires a lender (or its authorized agent) to use appraisers or supervisory appraisers that are state- licensed or state-certiﬁed (in accordance with the provisions of Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 and all applicable state laws). The lender (or its authorized agent) must document that the appraisers it uses are licensed or certiﬁed as appropriate under the applicable state law. The lender must ensure that the state license or state certiﬁcation is active as of the eﬀective date of the appraisal report. The appraiser must note their license or certiﬁcation number on the individual appraisal report forms, in compliance with the Uniform Appraisal Dataset Speciﬁcation, Appendix D: Field-Speciﬁc Standardization Requirements.
Fannie Mae’s appraisal report forms identify the appraiser as the individual who
performed the analysis, and
prepared and signed the appraisal report as the appraiser.
This does not preclude appraisers from relying on individuals who are not state-licensed or state-certiﬁed to provide signiﬁcant professional assistance, such as an appraiser trainee or an employee of the appraiser doing market data research or data veriﬁcation in the development of the appraisal. Under some state laws, a lender’s use of an unlicensed or uncertiﬁed appraiser that is working as an employee or sub-contractor of a licensed or certiﬁed appraiser will satisfy the state’s licensing and certiﬁcation requirement, as long as the appraisal report is signed by a state-licensed or state-certiﬁed supervisory or review appraiser. The state-licensed or state- certiﬁed appraiser that signs the appraisal report must acknowledge in the report the extent of the professional assistance provided by others and the speciﬁc tasks performed by each individual, and must certify that each named individual is qualiﬁed to perform the tasks.
Appraiser Trainees
Fannie Mae allows an unlicensed or uncertiﬁed appraiser, or trainee (or other similar classiﬁcation) to perform a signiﬁcant amount of the appraisal (or the entire appraisal if they are qualiﬁed to do so). If an unlicensed or uncertiﬁed individual provides signiﬁcant professional assistance, they must sign the left side of the appraiser certiﬁcation as the Appraiser if
they are working under the supervision of a state-licensed or state-certiﬁed appraiser as an employee or sub-contractor,
the right side of the appraiser certiﬁcation is signed by that supervisory appraiser, and
it is acceptable under state law.
If the jurisdiction does not provide license numbers for trainees, the term “Trainee” should be entered in the “Other” ﬁeld in the Appraiser Certiﬁcation section.
Knowledge and Experience
Lenders must use appraisers that
Published February 5, 2025
512
have the requisite knowledge required to perform a professional quality appraisal for the speciﬁc geographic location and particular property type; and
have the requisite knowledge about, and access to, all necessary and appropriate local data sources for the subject property's geographic area, including multiple listing service(s) and government records.
Appraisers that are not familiar with speciﬁc real estate markets may not have adequate information available to perform a reliable appraisal. Although the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) allows an appraiser that does not have the appropriate knowledge and experience to accept an appraisal assignment by providing procedures with which the appraiser can complete the assignment, Fannie Mae does not allow the USPAP ﬂexibility.
Selection of the Appraiser
The lender
is responsible for the selection of appraisers and for the qualiﬁcations and quality of work provided by the appraisers that are selected;
may not use appraisals ordered or received by borrowers or other parties with an interest in the transaction, such as the property seller or real estate agent. Fannie Mae does allow lenders to use third- party vendors (for example, appraisal management companies) to manage the appraiser selection process. However, it should be noted that if a lender enters into a contract with any vendor, contractor, or third-party service provider, the lender is accountable for the quality of the work performed as if it was performed by an employee of the lender.
The lender (or its authorized agent)
must establish policies and procedures to ensure that qualiﬁed individuals are being selected in accordance with Fannie Mae requirements, including the Appraiser Independence Requirements.
must ensure that an appraiser has demonstrated the ability to perform high-quality appraisals before using an appraiser’s services. The quality of an appraiser’s work is a key criterion that must be used in determining which appraiser the lender (or its authorized agent) uses for its assignments. The requirement for an appraiser to produce a high-quality work product must always outweigh fee or turnaround time considerations.
Delegating these responsibilities to a third party does not relieve the lender of its responsibilities related to the appraisal or the value, condition, and marketability of the property. See B4-1.3-12, Appraisal Quality Matters, for information related to ongoing review of appraisals.
Note: Fannie Mae does not approve appraisers. Therefore, when selecting appraisers, lenders must not give any consideration to an appraiser’s representation that they are approved or qualiﬁed by Fannie Mae.
Supervisory Appraiser
As noted in the License and Certiﬁcation section in this topic, Fannie Mae allows an unlicensed or uncertiﬁed appraiser, or trainee (or other similar classiﬁcation) that works as an employee or subcontractor of a licensed or
Published February 5, 2025
513
certiﬁed appraiser, to perform a signiﬁcant amount of the appraisal (or the entire appraisal if they are qualiﬁed to do so), as long as the appraisal report is signed by a licensed or certiﬁed supervisory or review appraiser and is acceptable under state law.
If a supervisory appraiser is used, the supervisory appraiser does not need to physically inspect the subject property or comparables, but must sign the right side of the report and certify that they
directly supervised the appraiser that prepared the appraisal report,
have reviewed the appraisal report,
agree with the statements and conclusions of the appraiser,
agree to be bound by certiﬁcations as set forth in Fannie Mae’s appraisal report forms, and
take full responsibility for the appraisal report.
A supervisory appraiser may not sign the left-hand side of the appraisal report unless they have met the requirements of the appraiser as noted in the License and Certiﬁcation section in this topic.

not supporting adjustments in the sales comparison approach;
failure to make market-derived adjustments, including time adjustments, when they are clearly indicated;
use of data, particularly comparable sales data, provided by parties that have a ﬁnancial interest in the sale or in the ﬁnancing of the subject property without the appraiser’s veriﬁcation of the information from a disinterested source;
development of an appraisal or reporting an appraisal in a manner or direction that favors the cause of either the client or any related party, the amount of the opinion of value, the attainment of a speciﬁc result, or the occurrence of a subsequent event in order to receive compensation or employment for

Introduction This topic contains information on lender disclosure of information to appraisers, including:
Overview Sales Contract Information Information Disclosed to the Appraiser Contract Changes After the Appraisal is Completed
Overview
All information about the subject property the lender is aware of must be disclosed to the appraiser and the details provided must comply with B4-1.1-04, Unacceptable Appraisal Practices. The appraiser must determine if the information could aﬀect either the marketability of the property or the opinion of the market value of the property.
Published February 5, 2025
516
Sales Contract Information
All ﬁnancing data and sales concessions for the subject property that will be or have been granted by anyone associated with the transaction must be disclosed to the appraiser, as appropriate. Typically, this information is provided in the sales contract. Therefore, the lender must provide, or ensure that the appraiser is provided with, a copy of the complete, ratiﬁed sales contract and all addenda for the property that is to be appraised.
Information Disclosed to the Appraiser
Financial Information
The list below includes items that must be disclosed to the appraiser on purchase transactions, if applicable:
settlement charges,
loan fees or charges,
discounts to the sales price,
interest rate buydowns,
below-market-rate ﬁnancing,
terms of any subordinate ﬁnancing provided by interested parties,
credits or refunds of borrower expenses,
absorption of monthly payments,
assignment of rent payments, and
any other information not listed above that impacts property value.
Property Information
The list below includes items that must be disclosed, if applicable:
condo or PUD fees;
non-realty items included in the transaction;
any environmental hazard in or on the subject property or in the vicinity of the property that the lender is aware of or learns from the borrower, the real estate agent, or any other party to the transaction (see B4-1.4-08, Environmental Hazards Appraisal Requirements); and
any other items that aﬀect the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of a property of which the lender may be aware.
Contract Changes After the Appraisal is Completed
If the contract is amended after the eﬀective date of the appraisal in a way that does not aﬀect the description of the property, then the lender is not required to provide the amended contract to the appraiser nor obtain a revised appraisal. Some examples of amendments that do not require the lender to provide the amended

contract nor obtain revisions to the already-completed appraisal report include:
sale price,
transaction terms,
ﬁnancing concessions,
seller-paid closing costs,

Introduction This topic contains information on the Uniform Appraisal Dataset and the Uniform Collateral Data Portal, including:
Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) Uniform Collateral Data Portal (UCDP)
Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD)
The UAD standardizes appraisal data elements for a subset of ﬁelds on speciﬁc appraisal report forms and includes all data elements required to complete these forms. Fannie Mae requires that the following appraisal report forms are completed utilizing Appendix D of the UAD Speciﬁcation when reporting the results of an appraisal for a conventional loan:
Uniform Residential Appraisal Report ( Form 1004), and
Individual Condominium Unit Appraisal Report ( Form 1073).
Published February 5, 2025
518
Note: Uniform Residential Appraisal Report (Desktop) (Form 1004 Desktop) should adhere to the UAD speciﬁcation for Form 1004.
Other appraisal report forms may be completed using the standards contained in the UAD Speciﬁcation to the extent those standards are applicable to that particular form. Lenders may obtain the most recent version of Appendix D of the Uniform Appraisal Dataset Speciﬁcation and additional information on Fannie Mae’s website.
Uniform Collateral Data Portal (UCDP)
The UCDP is a portal through which lenders are required to electronically submit appraisal reports for conventional loans delivered to Fannie Mae. The following appraisal report forms including all exhibits, addenda, and photographs, must be submitted through the UCDP and receive a “Successful” status from the UCDP prior to the delivery date of the loan:
Uniform Residential Appraisal Report ( Form 1004),
Uniform Residential Appraisal Report (Desktop) (Form 1004 Desktop),
Manufactured Home Appraisal Report ( Form 1004C),
Small Residential Income Property Appraisal Report (Form 1025),
Individual Condominium Unit Appraisal Report ( Form 1073), and
Individual Cooperative Interest Appraisal Report ( Form 2090).
If there are subsequent revisions to the appraisal report, the ﬁnal version of the report that was utilized in making the underwriting decision must be submitted through the UCDP and receive a “Successful” status from the UCDP prior to the delivery of the loan. When submitting an appraisal report through the UCDP, lenders must ensure that it is the unaltered report submitted by the identiﬁed appraiser.
Additionally, for loans that require an appraisal, lenders must ensure that the appraised value as indicated on the appraisal submitted in UCDP matches the appraised value as reported at delivery. An exception is allowed for this requirement when the appraisal used to underwrite the loan is a desk or ﬁeld review of an existing appraisal because those types of reports cannot be uploaded to UCDP. In those instances, the appraised value reported at delivery will reﬂect the value as stated in the desk or ﬁeld review. However, the original appraisal that was the subject of review must have been submitted to UCDP.
Appraisal report forms not listed above cannot be delivered through UCDP with the exception of the Appraisal Update and/or Completion Certiﬁcate ( Form 1004D ), which is optional. Lenders must maintain the applicable appraisal report and attachments in the loan ﬁle as part of the underwriting documents in accordance with A2-4.1-02, Ownership and Retention of Loan Files and Records. Lenders may obtain detailed information on the UCDP page on Fannie Mae’s website.

Scope of Work List of Appraisal Report Forms Exhibits for Appraisals Appraiser Certiﬁcations and Limiting Conditions
Scope of Work
Appraisers must use the most recent version of the appraisal report forms and include any other information, either as an attachment or addendum to the appraisal report form, needed to adequately support the opinion of market value. Although the scope of work for the appraisal or the extent of the appraisal process is guided by Fannie Mae’s appraisal report forms, the forms do not limit or control the appraisal process. The appraiser’s analysis should go beyond any limitations of the forms, with additional comments and exhibits being used if they are needed to adequately describe the subject property, document the analysis and valuation process, or support the appraiser’s conclusions. The extent of the appraiser’s data collection, analysis, and reporting must be determined by the complexity of the appraisal assignment.

For traditional appraisals of one-unit properties and units in PUDs (including
those that have an illegal second unit or accessory dwelling unit) based on an
interior and exterior on-site physical inspection of the property by the
appraiser. Form 1004 also may be used for two-unit properties, if each of the
units is occupied by one of the co-borrowers as their principal residence or if
the value of the legal second unit is relatively insigniﬁcant in relation to the
total value of the property (as might be the case for a basement unit or a unit
over a garage). In addition, appraisals for units in condo projects that consist
solely of detached dwellings may be documented on Form 1004, if the
appraiser includes an adequate description of the project and information
about the homeowners’ association fees and the quality of the project
maintenance. Appraisals reported on Form 1004 must be completed in
accordance with the UAD Speciﬁcation.
For appraisals of one-unit properties and units in PUDs (including those that

appraiser. The property data may be collected through secondary data
sources or by someone other than the appraiser. This form is not designed to
report an appraisal for a manufactured home, or for a unit in a condo or co-op
project. Appraisals reported on Form 1004 Desktop must be completed in
accordance with the UAD Speciﬁcation.
For appraisals of one-unit properties and units in PUDs (including those that
have an illegal second unit or accessory dwelling unit) that are based on

Appraiser Certiﬁcations and Limiting Conditions
Each Fannie Mae appraisal report form includes an appraiser’s certiﬁcation (and, if applicable, a supervisory appraiser’s certiﬁcation) and a statement of assumptions and limiting conditions. Appraisers may not add limiting conditions.
The appraiser may not make changes or deletions to the existing certiﬁcations; however, the appraiser may make additional certiﬁcations that can be included on a separate page or form. Acceptable additional certiﬁcations might include:
those required by state law;
those related to the appraiser’s continuing education or membership in an appraisal organization; or
those related to the appraiser’s compliance with privacy laws and regulations in the development, reporting, and storage of an appraisal and the information on which it is based.
Lenders are responsible for reviewing any additional certiﬁcations made by appraisers to ensure that they do not conﬂict with Fannie Mae’s policies or standard certiﬁcations on Fannie Mae appraisal forms.
Published February 5, 2025
524
The appraiser’s certiﬁcation #23 is an acknowledgment by the appraiser that certain parties to a mortgage ﬁnance transaction that are not the lender/client and/or intended user may rely on the appraisal report. This certiﬁcation clariﬁes that such other parties include the borrower, another lender at the request of the borrower, the mortgagee or its successors and assigns, mortgage insurers, government-sponsored enterprises, and other secondary market participants.
Fannie Mae will accept the following additional notice or statement when appraisers believe the lender/client is the only intended user:
“The intended user of this appraisal report is the lender/client. The intended use is to evaluate the property that is the subject of this appraisal for a mortgage ﬁnance transaction, subject to the stated scope of work, purpose of the appraisal, reporting requirements of this appraisal report form, and deﬁnition of market value. No additional intended users are identiﬁed by the appraiser.”

B4-1.2-02, Desktop Appraisals (02/05/2025)
Introduction This topic contains information on desktop appraisals, including:
Overview Completing the Form 1004 Desktop Eligible Transactions Ineligible Transactions Representations and Warranties
Overview
A desktop appraisal reported on the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report (Desktop) (Form 1004 Desktop) is permitted for certain transactions. The minimum scope of work for Form 1004 Desktop does not include a current inspection of the subject property or comparable sales by the appraiser; the appraiser relies on data obtained from alternative methods or sources to identify property characteristics and condition.
Completing the Form 1004 Desktop
Subject property information may be obtained from one or more data sources. The appraiser can accept data, photos, ﬂoor plans, and other information from a party who has a ﬁnancial interest in the sale or ﬁnancing of the property if the appraiser veriﬁes such data from a disinterested source. The appraiser must determine if the information is accurate and reliable to produce a credible report, which includes the features, quality, and condition of the subject property.
Virtual inspection methods (including digital photos or videos) or other technological solutions (such as a machine-generated ﬂoor plan) can augment the data and imagery used for a desktop appraisal. Information provided by the homeowner, potential borrower, or a third party can be used to develop the description of the interior and exterior of the improvements. Extraordinary assumption(s) or appraisals made "subject to" veriﬁcation of the subject property's condition, quality, or physical characteristics are not permitted.
The lender remains responsible for the description of the property, and the accuracy and of all data on the appraisal that pertains to the property. This includes the property's condition and quality ratings. The lender is also responsible for ensuring the property meets the property eligibility requirements in this Selling Guide. Lastly, the lender remains responsible for any life-of-loan representations and warranties that may apply to the property or the appraisal.
Exhibits: Form 1004 Desktop requires the same exhibits as traditional appraisals, plus a ﬂoor plan. The Square Footage-Method for Calculating: ANSI Z765-2021 standard and exception code (GXX001- in the Additional Features ﬁeld) is not required for desktop appraisals but encouraged when feasible. See B4-1.2-01, Appraisal Report Forms and Exhibits for additional information.
Entry of Appraisal Assignment Type: The appraiser must provide the Appraisal Assignment Type and supporting details (located in the Additional Comments section of the appraisal report) as shown in the following

DU Messaging: For loan caseﬁles that are eligible for a desktop appraisal option, DU will issue a message informing the lender they can choose to obtain an appraisal reported on Form 1004 Desktop. DU will also issue messages for other appraisal options. The lender may select from any of the options presented, which may include a desktop appraisal, hybrid appraisal, or traditional appraisal.
Eligible Transactions
To be eligible for a desktop appraisal, transactions must meet the following criteria:
one-unit property (including those with an ADU and units in a PUD), principal residence, purchase transaction (including new construction), LTV ratio less than or equal to 90%, and DU loan caseﬁle that receives an Approve/Eligible recommendation.

Overview Completing the Hybrid Appraisal Eligible Transactions Ineligible Transactions Exercising Hybrid Appraisals Representations and Warranties
Overview
For certain loan caseﬁles, DU oﬀers hybrid appraisals - an appraisal option requiring a property data collection.
Published February 5, 2025
528
A hybrid appraisal reported on the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report (Hybrid) (Form 1004 Hybrid) or Individual Condominium Unit Appraisal Report (Hybrid) (Form 1073 Hybrid) must conform to B4-1.1-04, Unacceptable Appraisal Practices. The minimum scope of work for hybrid appraisals includes consideration by the appraiser of interior and exterior property data collection by a trained and vetted third party (such as a real estate agent, insurance inspector, appraiser, etc.). The appraiser relies on the data collected (and other sources if needed) to identify property characteristics including condition. The property data collection must comply with the Uniform Property Dataset and be delivered to the Fannie Mae Property Data API.
Completing the Hybrid Appraisal
Property data collection and the appraisal report are separate assignments and may be performed by diﬀerent people. If the appraiser does not perform the data collection, the lender must share the property data collection with the appraiser at the time of engagement. The appraiser will use the data along with other third-party sources to develop the appraisal. The eﬀective date of the hybrid appraisal is the date that the appraiser arrives at their opinion of value.
Note: If the appraiser is engaged as a property data collector and at a later date engaged as an appraiser, this is still considered a hybrid appraisal.
The lender remains responsible for verifying the accuracy of the property description and the completeness of the data including the condition and quality ratings as determined by the appraiser. The lender is also responsible for ensuring the property meets the property eligibility requirements in this Selling Guide. Lastly, the lender remains responsible for any life-of-loan representations and warranties that may apply to the property or the appraisal.
Exhibits: Form 1004 Hybrid and Form 1073 Hybrid require the same exhibits as traditional appraisals with the inclusion of a ﬂoor plan conforming to the ANSI standard. See B4-1.2-01, Appraisal Report Forms and Exhibits for additional information on exhibits and B4-1.3-05, Improvements Section of the Appraisal Report for additional information on the ANSI standard.
Entry of Appraisal Assignment Type: The appraiser must provide the Appraisal Assignment Type and supporting details (located in the Additional Comments section of the appraisal report) as shown in the following table.

Note: For the Subject Property Data Collection Date, the appraiser must enter the date that the property data collection was performed. For the Subject Property Data Workforce, the appraiser must enter the Workforce indicated in the property data that is one of the six Required Entry enumerations listed above.
DU Messaging: For loan caseﬁles that are eligible for a hybrid appraisal option, DU will issue a message informing the lender they can obtain an appraisal reported on Form 1004 Hybrid or Form 1073 Hybrid. DU will also issue messages for other appraisal options. The lender may select from any of the options presented, which may include a hybrid appraisal, desktop appraisal, or traditional appraisal.
Eligible Transactions
The following are eligible for a hybrid appraisal:
existing one-unit properties, including a condo or unit in a PUD; principal residence, second home, or investment properties; under construction properties; existing properties with incomplete construction or renovation project; community land trusts, or other properties with resale price restrictions, which include loan caseﬁles using the Aﬀordable LTV feature; and Texas 50(a)(6) loans.
The transaction must be a purchase, limited cash-out reﬁnance, or cash-out reﬁnance.
Ineligible Transactions
The following transactions are not eligible for a hybrid appraisal:
two- to four-unit properties; co-op units; manufactured homes; proposed construction; construction-to-permanent loans (single-close and two-close); HomeStyle Renovation and HomeStyle Energy loans; DU loan caseﬁles that receive an Ineligible recommendation; and manually underwritten loans.
Published February 5, 2025

Exercising Hybrid Appraisals
When exercising a hybrid appraisal, the lender must complete all of the following:
obtain a property data collection and successfully submit to the Fannie Mae Property Data API. provide the property data collection to an appraiser for the completion of a hybrid appraisal based on property type using either Form 1004 Hybrid or Form 1073 Hybrid. submit the hybrid appraisal to the Uniform Collateral Data Portal (UCDP). perform an appraisal review in accordance with this Guide. deliver the loan with the hybrid appraisal to Fannie Mae.
Note: A lender may obtain a hybrid appraisal if a loan loses value acceptance + property data eligibility after submitting the property data collection to the Property Data API. See B4-1.4-11, Value Acceptance + Property Data for speciﬁc requirements.
Representations and Warranties
When a hybrid appraisal is reported on Form 1004 Hybrid or Form 1073 Hybrid and submitted through the UCDP, the appraisal will be scored by Collateral Underwriter (CU). All eligible loans with a hybrid appraisal receiving a CU risk score of 2.5 or less are eligible for enforcement relief of certain representations and warranties related to the appraisal value of the subject property (see A2-2-06, Representations and Warranties on Property Value for complete requirements and additional information).

B4-1.2-04, Appraisal Age and Use Requirements (03/01/2023)
Introduction This topic contains information about the following:
Age of Appraisal and Appraisal Update Requirements Multiple Appraisals of the Subject Property Use of an Appraisal for a Subsequent Transaction
Age of Appraisal and Appraisal Update Requirements
When an appraisal is obtained, the property must be appraised within the 12 months prior to the date of the note and mortgage.
When the eﬀective date of the original appraisal report is more than four months but less than 12 months from the date of the note and mortgage, the appraiser must perform an appraisal update that includes inspecting the exterior of the property and reviewing current market data to determine whether the property has declined in value since the date of the original appraisal report. This policy applies regardless of whether the property was appraised as proposed or existing construction. The appraisal update must occur within four months prior to the date of the note and mortgage.
The original appraiser should complete the appraisal update; however, lenders may use substitute appraisers. When updates are completed by substitute appraisers, the substitute appraiser must review the original appraisal report and express an opinion about whether the original appraisers opinion of market value was reasonable on the date of the original appraisal report. The lender must note in the ﬁle why the original appraiser was not used.
The inspection and results of the appraisal update must be reported on the Appraisal Update and/or Completion Report (Form 1004D).
If the appraiser indicates on the Form 1004D that the property value has declined, then the lender must obtain a new appraisal for the property.
If the appraiser indicates on the Form 1004D that the property value has not declined, then the lender may proceed with the loan in process without requiring any additional ﬁeldwork.
When the eﬀective date of the original appraisal report is more than 12 months from the date of the note and mortgage (with or without an appraisal update) a new appraisal report is required. Except for single-close construction-to-permanent ﬁnancing loans, these policies apply to all appraisals including those that receive appraisal and value representation and warranty enforcement relief (see B5-3.1-02, Conversion of Construction- to-Permanent Financing: Single-Closing Transactions).
See B4-1.3-12, Appraisal Quality Matters, for information concerning changes to the appraised value. See B2-1.5-02, Loan Eligibility, for information regarding property valuation requirements for mortgage loans sold to Fannie Mae more than four months from the note date.
Published February 5, 2025
532
Desktop Appraisals
When the eﬀective date of the original desktop appraisal report is more than four months from the date of the note and mortgage, a new appraisal is required.
Multiple Appraisals of the Subject Property
If the lender obtains more than one appraisal for a loan due to applicable law, regulation, lender policy, or otherwise, the lender must
adhere to a policy of selecting the most reliable appraisal rather than the appraisal that states the highest value,
document the reasons for relying on the appraisal, and
submit the appraisal selected by the lender through the UCDP prior to delivery.
These requirements also apply if the lender considers an appraisal to be deﬁcient (see B4-1.3-12, Appraisal Quality Matters).
Use of an Appraisal for a Subsequent Transaction
Fannie Mae will allow the use of an origination appraisal for a subsequent transaction if the following requirements are met:
The subsequent transaction may only be a limited cash-out reﬁnance.
The age of the appraisal report must be less than 12 months from the note date of the subsequent transaction. If the appraisal report is greater than four months from the date of the note and mortgage, then an appraisal update is required. See preceding section, Age of Appraisal and Appraisal Update Requirements, for requirements for completing an appraisal update.
The lender must ensure that the property has not undergone any signiﬁcant remodeling, renovation, or deterioration to the extent that the improvement or deterioration of the property would materially aﬀect the market value of the subject property.
The borrower and the lender/client must be the same on the original and subsequent transaction.
Note: The appraisal must comply with all other requirements in the Underwriting Property section of the Selling Guide.

B4-1.2-05, Requirements for Verifying Completion and Postponed
Improvements (03/01/2023)
Introduction This topic contains information on requirements for verifying completion of construction and repairs, and requirements for postponed improvements, including:
Overview Form 1004D and Completion Alternatives Veriﬁcation of Completion: New or Proposed Construction Veriﬁcation of Completion: Existing Construction Postponed Improvements
Overview
Generally, improvements, alterations, and repairs on the subject property must be complete when the mortgage is sold to Fannie Mae. Lenders must obtain evidence of completion and Fannie Mae allows for a variety of methods depending on the type of valuation method and condition (completion, alteration, or repair) that must be conﬁrmed.
Additionally, in some circumstances, Fannie Mae allows a loan to be sold prior to improvements or repairs being completed if the lender complies with the requirements related to postponed improvements.
Form 1004D and Completion Alternatives
Form 1004D
The Appraisal Update and/or Completion Report (Form 1004D) is used to update an appraisal or provide conﬁrmation that the requirements or conditions in an appraisal report have been met (such as completion of
Published February 5, 2025
534
construction or repairs).
The appraiser can complete the Completion Report section of Form 1004D based on an on-site visual inspection of the property. The appraiser may also complete the form based on alternative methods, such as virtual inspections, digital photos, site videos, or other technological solutions. All completion documentation must include one or more visually veriﬁable exhibits. A link to the digital exhibits from within the form is acceptable but must be accessible by Fannie Mae for the life of the loan. These exhibits must be unaltered and able to be authenticated using metadata and the geocode for the subject property.
See B4-1.2-04, Appraisal Age and Use Requirements, for certiﬁcations completed by substitute appraisers.
Attestation Letters
Fannie Mae also permits other completion alternative methods - attestation letters - to verify completion of construction, alteration, or repairs in lieu of Form 1004D.
Borrower/builder attestation letter: For new or proposed construction, a letter is permitted to conﬁrm the property was completed and constructed in conformity with the plans and speciﬁcations, amendments, and change orders. The borrower/builder attestation letter must include (at a minimum) the following items:
borrower name, property address or legal description if the address is not available, certiﬁcation language that the property was constructed in conformity with the plans and speciﬁcations including any amendments or changes, signatures and dates by the borrower(s) and builder, and exterior and interior photos of the property (see B4-1.2-01, Appraisal Report Forms and Exhibits).
If a letter signed by both parties is not obtainable, then a Form 1004D completed by the appraiser is required.
Borrower attestation letter: A letter is permitted to conﬁrm completion of certain alterations or repairs for existing construction. The letter must include (at a minimum) the following:
borrower name; property address; certiﬁcation language that the alteration or repair was satisfactorily completed; signatures and date of the borrower; visually veriﬁable exhibits of the completed work; and one of the following
signature of the qualiﬁed professional, a professionally prepared report, or paid invoices for the alterations or repairs.
When either of these attestation letter options is used, a link within the letter to any digital exhibits is acceptable but must be accessible by Fannie Mae for the life of the loan. These exhibits must be unaltered and able to be authenticated using metadata and the geocode for the subject property. The letter and all documentation must be retained in the loan ﬁle.
Criteria for Use of Form 1004D and Completion Alternatives
Use of Form 1004D and completion alternatives varies depending on the type of valuation method and condition (completion, alteration, inspection, or repair) that must be veriﬁed.

Veriﬁcation of Completion: New or Proposed Construction
When the property securing the mortgage is new or proposed construction, the appraisal must be based on either plans and speciﬁcations, an existing model home, or other information suﬃcient to identify the quality and character to accurately report the interior features of the proposed improvements.
Veriﬁcation of completion of construction is required (in accordance with the requirements above) before sale of the loan to Fannie Mae, unless the lender complies with the postponed improvements policies described below.
Veriﬁcation of Completion: Existing Construction
Lenders must review the appraisal to ensure that the property does not have minor conditions or deferred maintenance items that aﬀect the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the subject property. See B4-1.3-06, Property Condition and Quality of Construction of the Improvements, for information concerning property condition and quality of construction ratings.
Published February 5, 2025

The tables below provide requirements related to existing properties that have physical deﬁciencies, minor conditions, or deferred maintenance items that may or may not aﬀect the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the property.
✓
Requirements for Existing Construction When There are Minor Conditions or Deferred Maintenance Items that Do Not Aﬀect the Safety, Soundness, or Structural Integrity of the Property
When the appraisal shows the existence of minor conditions or deferred maintenance that does not
aﬀect the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the property, these items must be reﬂected
in the appraiser's opinion of value and the appraisal report must be completed "as-is." Items
meeting these criteria require the appraiser to report and comment on the eﬀect these items may
have on the subject property's value and marketability. The lender will then evaluate and
determine if any additional course of action is required to comply with Fannie Mae's safety,
soundness, and structural integrity requirements. Minor conditions and deferred maintenance
items include, but are not limited to, worn ﬂoor ﬁnishes or carpet, minor plumbing leaks, holes in
window screens, missing handrails, or cracked window glass and are typically due to normal wear
and tear. The lender is not required to ensure that the borrower has had these items repaired prior
to sale of the loan to Fannie Mae when the appraisal is completed "as-is."
If there are minor conditions or deferred maintenance items to be remedied or completed after
closing, the lender may escrow for these items at its own discretion and still sell the loan to Fannie
Mae prior to the release of the escrow as long as the lender can ensure that these items do not
aﬀect the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the property.
Lenders must ensure the escrow account is a custodial account that satisﬁes Fannie Mae’s criteria
for custodial accounts and depositories as outlines in Servicing Guide topic A4-1-02, Establishing
Custodial Bank Accounts.
✓
Requirements for Existing Construction When There are Incomplete Items or Conditions that Aﬀect the Safety, Soundness, or Structural Integrity of the Property
When an appraisal is required and there are incomplete items, physical deﬁciencies, or items
aﬀecting the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the improvements, the appraisal must be
"subject to" completion of the speciﬁc repairs or alterations. This may include but is not limited to
foundation settlement, water seepage, active roof leaks, worn roof shingles, inadequate electrical
service or plumbing ﬁxtures, etc.
Incomplete items, physical deﬁciencies, or items aﬀecting safety, soundness, or structural integrity
may also be identiﬁed through the property data collection process.
In all cases, the lender must verify completion before the loan is sold to Fannie Mae. See Form
1004D and Completion Alternatives above for the speciﬁc requirements.
Published February 5, 2025

Postponed Improvements
Fannie Mae allows the sale of a loan before construction or energy improvements are complete if certain requirements are met.
The table below describes requirements related to properties that are new or proposed construction that are not complete when the loan is sold to Fannie Mae.
✓
Requirements for New or Proposed Construction
Loans may be delivered before postponed items are complete; however, the postponed
improvements must be completed within 180 days of the date of the note. Acceptable postponed
items include items that:
are part of the sales contract (third-party contracts are not permissible);
are postponed for a valid reason, such as inclement weather or a shortage of building materials;
and
do not aﬀect the ability to obtain an occupancy permit.
Completion must be conﬁrmed using Form 1004D or an acceptable completion alternative as
described above. All documentation must be retained in the loan ﬁle.
The cost of completing improvements must not represent more than 10% of the “as completed”
appraised value of the property.
Lenders must establish a completion escrow for the postponed improvements, by withholding from
the purchase proceeds funds equal to 120% of the estimated cost for completing the
improvements. However, if the contractor or builder oﬀers a guaranteed ﬁxed-price contract for
completion of the improvements, the funds in the completion escrow only need to equal the full
amount of the contract price.
Lenders must ensure the escrow account is a custodial account that satisﬁes Fannie Mae’s criteria
for custodial accounts and depositories as outlined in Servicing Guide topic A4-1-02, Establishing
Custodial Bank Accounts.
Lenders and borrowers must execute an escrow agreement that states how the escrow account will
be managed and how funds from the escrow account will be disbursed.
The completion escrow may not adversely aﬀect the mortgage insurance or title insurance.
Published February 5, 2025

✓
Requirements for New or Proposed Construction
After a satisfactory Form 1004D or completion alternative is obtained, the lender must release the
ﬁnal draw from the escrow account, which should include any funds in excess of the amount
needed to pay for completion of the postponed items.
Lenders must obtain a ﬁnal title report, which must not show any outstanding mechanic’s liens,
take any exceptions to the postponed improvements, or take any exceptions to the escrow
agreement. If the ﬁnal title report is issued before the completion of the improvements, lenders
must obtain an endorsement to the title policy that ensures the priority of Fannie Mae’s lien.
Requirements for HomeStyle Energy Improvements on Existing Construction
The table below provides the postponed improvement requirements for a HomeStyle Energy loan. (These requirements are not applicable when energy improvements are included in HomeStyle Renovation loan).
✓
Requirements for HomeStyle Energy Improvements on Existing Construction
Mortgages may be delivered before the energy-related improvements are complete; however, the
postponed improvements must be completed within 180 days of the date of the mortgage note.
Acceptable postponed items include items that will not prevent the issuance of an occupancy
permit.
A certiﬁcation of completion must be obtained to verify the work was completed and must:
be completed by the appraiser,
state that the improvements were completed in accordance with the requirements and conditions
in the original appraisal report, and
be accompanied by photographs of the completed improvements.
Lenders must establish a completion escrow for the postponed energy-related improvements by
withholding funds equal to 120% of the estimated cost for completing the improvements. However,
if the contractor oﬀers a guaranteed ﬁxed-price contract for completion of the improvements, the
funds in the completion escrow only need to equal the full amount of the contract price.
Lender must ensure the escrow account is a custodial account that satisﬁes Fannie Mae’s criteria
for custodial accounts and depositories as outlined in Servicing Guide topic A4-1-02, Establishing
Custodial Bank Accounts.

Requirements for HomeStyle Energy Improvements on Existing Construction
Lenders and borrowers must execute an escrow agreement that states how the escrow account will
be managed and how funds from the escrow account will be disbursed.
The completion escrow may not adversely aﬀect the mortgage insurance or title insurance.
Once a certiﬁcate of completion is obtained, the lender must release the ﬁnal draw from the escrow
account, which should include any funds in excess of the amount needed to pay for completion of
the postponed items. Any funds remaining in the escrow account after the work is completed must
be applied to reduce the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loan. The value of sweat equity
and “Do It Yourself” improvements are not reimbursable.
Lenders must obtain a ﬁnal title report, which must not show any outstanding mechanic’s liens,
take any exceptions to the postponed improvements, or take any exceptions to the escrow
agreement. If the ﬁnal title report is issued before the completion of the improvements, lenders
must obtain an endorsement to the title policy that ensures the priority of Fannie Mae’s lien.

Overview Appraisal Report Analysis
Overview
Fannie Mae’s appraisal report forms and the appraisal review requirements for one- to four-unit properties have been developed with the intent that the USPAP standards are followed and that Fannie Mae’s policies are supportive of fair lending practices. This topic provides lender requirements related to the transaction details and the property and appraisal eligibility analysis.
Appraisal Report Analysis
When an appraisal is obtained, the lender must analyze the
current contract for sale for purchase money transactions,
current oﬀering or listing for sale for both purchase and reﬁnance transactions when the home was listed for sale,
comparable sales for both purchase and reﬁnance transactions, and
current ownership for the subject property (see B4-1.1-02, Lender Responsibilities, for further information).
The lender is responsible for validating that
the property meets Fannie Mae’s eligibility criteria (see B2-3-01, General Property Eligibility, for eligibility requirements);
the appraiser has provided an accurate and reliable opinion of value that reﬂects the market value, condition, and marketability of the subject property in compliance with Fannie Mae’s Selling Guide requirements. (See B4-1.3-12, Appraisal Quality Matters, for further information); and
the appraisal conforms with B4-1.1-04, Unacceptable Appraisal Practices.

(04/15/2014)
Introduction This topic contains information on reviewing the Subject and Contract sections of the appraisal report form, including:
Subject Section Contract Section
Subject Section
The appraiser must identify the subject property by its complete property address and legal description. The appraiser must enter the physical property address, including the unit number for a condo, in a format that conforms to the United States Postal Service (USPS) address standards in Publication 28 – Postal Addressing Standards (pub28) for complete addresses. Address standards can be found at usps.com. The subject address must be populated consistently throughout the form.
When the legal description is lengthy, the appraiser may attach the full legal description as an addendum to the appraisal report. The appraiser must also identify the property rights to be appraised. (For eligibility requirements, see B2-3-01, General Property Eligibility.)
Fannie Mae's appraisal report forms require the appraiser to research and identify whether the subject property is currently for sale or if it has been oﬀered for sale in the 12 months prior to the eﬀective date of the appraisal by selecting either the ‘Yes’ or the ‘No’ checkbox. If the answer is ‘No,’ the data source(s) used must be provided. If the answer is ‘Yes,’ the appraiser must report on each occurrence or listing and provide the following information:
oﬀering price(s),
oﬀering date(s), and
data source(s) used.
For example, if the subject property is currently listed for sale and was previously listed eight months ago, the appraiser must report on both oﬀerings.
Note: For appraisals required to be UAD compliant, Days on Market (DOM) must be reported.
Published February 5, 2025
542
See Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Uniform Appraisal Dataset Speciﬁcation, Appendix D: Field-Speciﬁc Standardization Requirements, and the associated FAQ’s, for additional information and examples regarding these topics.
Contract Section
The lender must provide the appraiser with a copy of the complete, ratiﬁed contract. The appraiser must indicate whether an analysis was or was not performed on the contract for sale. If an analysis was performed, the appraiser must provide the results of the analysis. If an analysis was not performed, the appraiser must provide an explanation why the analysis was not performed.
For appraisals required to be UAD compliant, the appraiser must also indicate the type of sale for the transaction. The appraiser may report any other relevant information in this ﬁeld or elsewhere in the report regarding the sale type, including whether more than one sale type applies.
The appraiser must
enter an amount in the Contract Price ﬁeld if the Assignment Type is a purchase transaction. Contract price must be the same as the sales price for the subject property in the Sales Comparison Approach section;
enter a contract date if the Assignment Type is a purchase transaction; and
indicate if the property seller is the owner of record.
The appraiser must indicate if there is any ﬁnancial assistance such as loan charges, sales concessions or gift, or down payment assistance to be paid by any party on behalf of the borrower, including any closing costs or other payments from the seller or other third party. If there is ﬁnancial assistance, the appraiser must
report the total dollar amount of the loan charges or concessions that will be paid (if the appraiser is not able to determine a dollar amount for all or part of the ﬁnancial assistance, the number must reﬂect the total known dollar amount); and
provide a description of the items being paid.
Note: Financial assistance or concessions paid by any party on behalf of the borrower includes both monetary and non-monetary items, including below-market-rate mortgage ﬁnancing, gifts of personal property, and payment of property taxes or HOA dues for a period of time.

Overview Neighborhood Analysis Degree of Development and Growth Rate Trend of Neighborhood Property Values, Demand/Supply, and Marketing Time Price Range and Predominant Price Over-Improvements Age Range and Predominant Age Present Land Use
Overview
Neighborhood characteristics and trends inﬂuence the value of one- to four-unit residences and an analysis of the subject property’s neighborhood is a key element in the appraisal process. A neighborhood is deﬁned as a congruous group of complementary land uses.
Neighborhood Analysis
Fannie Mae requires the appraiser to perform an objective neighborhood analysis by identifying neighborhood boundaries, neighborhood characteristics, and the factors that aﬀect the value and marketability of properties in the neighborhood.
Neighborhood boundaries. The appraiser should provide an outline of the neighborhood boundaries, which should be clearly delineated using ‘North’, ‘South’, ‘East’, and ‘West’. These boundaries may include, but are not limited to streets, legally recognized neighborhood boundaries, waterways, or other natural boundaries that deﬁne the separation of one neighborhood from another.

Neighborhood characteristics. These can be addressed by the types of structures (detached, attached) and architectural styles in the neighborhood (such as row or townhouse, colonial, ranch, or Victorian); current land use (such as single-family residential, commercial, or industrial); typical site size (such as 10000 sf, or 2.00 ac); or street patterns or design (such as one-way street, cul-de-sac, or court).
Factors that aﬀect the value and marketability of properties in the neighborhood. These can be addressed by such things as the proximity of the property to employment and amenities, appeal to the market, changes in land use, access to public transportation, and adverse environmental inﬂuences.
The appraiser must fully consider all of the value-inﬂuencing characteristics in the neighborhood and arrive at an appropriate neighborhood description and opinion of value for the property, even if this requires more

extensive research for particular property types or for properties in certain geographic locations.
An appraiser must perform a neighborhood analysis in order to identify the area that is subject to the same inﬂuences as the property being appraised, based on the actions of typical buyers. The results of a neighborhood analysis enable the appraiser not only to identify the factors that inﬂuence the value of properties in the neighborhood, but also to deﬁne the area from which to select the market data needed to perform a sales comparison analysis.
In performing a neighborhood analysis, the appraiser
collects pertinent data,
researches the neighborhood to identify physical characteristics and determine its boundaries, and
identiﬁes land uses and any signs that the land uses are changing.
Fannie Mae expects the appraiser and the lender’s underwriter to be aware of the varying conditions that characterize diﬀerent types of neighborhoods. Conditions that are typical in certain neighborhoods may not be present in other neighborhoods. This does not mean that the existence of certain types of conditions or characteristics are unacceptable; rather, it is an indication that they must be viewed in context with the nature of the neighborhood in which the security property is located. For example, some neighborhoods consist of a variety of property types that have diﬀerent uses. It is not uncommon to ﬁnd properties that have mixed-uses, such as residential properties that also have child-care facilities, doctor or dental oﬃces, and other types of business or commercial uses. The presence of mixed-use properties or a variety of property types within a neighborhood should be viewed as a neighborhood characteristic that the appraiser considers when performing the neighborhood analysis and describing the neighborhood boundaries.
The appraiser must consider the inﬂuence of market forces, including economic, governmental, and environmental factors on property values in the neighborhood. Economic forces that must be considered include such things as the existence of vacant or boarded-up properties in the neighborhood and the level of essential local support services. Examples of governmental forces that should be taken into consideration include the regulations, laws, and taxes that are imposed on properties. Environmental forces that must be considered include, among other things, the existence of a hazardous waste site on or near the property, the proximity of a property to an airport, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) designated ﬂood zone in which the property is located. Characteristics that are not appraisal factors must not be considered in the valuation process either partially or completely. These characteristics include a person's sex, race, color, religion, disability, national origin, or familial status. Also, no reference to any protected class of either the prospective owners or occupants of the subject property or the present owners or occupants of the properties in the vicinity of the subject property should be considered or reported.
The appraiser must determine, analyze, and consider factors in the valuation process based on their identiﬁcation of all forces or factors that have the potential to inﬂuence the value of the property. The appraiser must report neighborhood conditions in factual, speciﬁc terms and be impartial and speciﬁc in describing favorable or unfavorable factors in a neighborhood. If an appraiser can demonstrate by market evidence that a characteristic has an eﬀect on the value or marketability of the properties in the neighborhood, they must consider it in the valuation process. The appraiser must not make unsupported assumptions or interject personal opinion or perceptions about market forces or other factors that may or may not aﬀect the use and value of a property.
Degree of Development and Growth Rate
Published February 5, 2025
545
The degree of development of a neighborhood, which is referred to as “built-up” on the appraisal report forms, is the percentage of the available land in the neighborhood that has been improved. The degree of development of a neighborhood may indicate whether a particular property is residential in nature.
When reviewing an appraisal on a property located in a rural or relatively undeveloped area, the lender should focus on the characteristics of the property, zoning, and the present land use to determine whether the property should be considered residential in nature. For example, if the typical one-unit building site in a particular area (based on the zoning, the highest and best use of the land, and the present land use) is two acres in size, the mortgage will be eligible for purchase or securitization regardless of the percentage of the total appraised value of the property that the site represents, as long as the appraiser demonstrates through the use of comparable sales that the property is a typical residential property for that particular neighborhood.
Because Fannie Mae does not purchase or securitize mortgages secured by agricultural-type properties, undeveloped land, or land-development-type properties, the lender must review the appraisal report for properties that have sites larger than those typical for residential properties in the neighborhood. Special attention must be given to the appraiser’s description of the neighborhood, zoning, the highest and best use determination, and the degree of comparability between the subject property and the comparable sales. If the subject property has a signiﬁcantly larger site than the comparables used in the appraiser’s analysis, the subject property may not be a typical residential property for the neighborhood.
Trend of Neighborhood Property Values, Demand/Supply, and Marketing Time
The appraiser must report the primary indicators of market condition for properties in the subject neighborhood as of the eﬀective date of the appraisal by noting the information in the table below.
Trend of Property Values
Supply of Properties in the Subject Neighborhood
Marketing Time for Properties
increasing,
shortage,
under three months,
stable, or
in-balance, or
three to six months, or
declining.
over-supply.
over six months.
The appraiser’s analysis of a property must take into consideration all factors that aﬀect value. Because Fannie Mae purchases mortgages in all markets, this is particularly important for neighborhoods that are experiencing signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations in property values including sub-markets for particular types of housing within the neighborhood. Therefore, lenders must conﬁrm the appraiser analyzes listings and contract sales as well as closed or settled sales, and uses the most recent and similar sales available as part of the sales comparison approach, with particular attention to sales or ﬁnancing concessions in neighborhoods that are experiencing either declining property values, an over-supply of properties, or marketing times over six months. The appraiser must provide their conclusions for the reasons a neighborhood is experiencing declining property values, an over-supply of properties, or marketing times over six months.
When completing the One-Unit Housing Trends portion of the Neighborhood section of the appraisal report, the trends must be reﬂective of those properties deemed to be competitive to the property being appraised. If the neighborhood contains properties that are truly competitive (that is, market participants make no distinction between the properties), then all the properties within the neighborhood would be reﬂected in the One-Unit Housing Trends section. The appraiser's analysis of the property value housing trend section (increasing, stable,
Published February 5, 2025
546
declining) must include factual data from information sources such as, but not limited to, market data, home price indices, multiple listing services, public records, and/or models. The trend indicated in the appraisal report must reﬂect the overall movement of the market based on a minimum of 12 months of data.
Price Range and Predominant Price
The appraiser must indicate the price range and predominant price of properties in the subject's neighborhood. The price range must reﬂect high and low prevailing prices for one-unit properties, two- to four-unit properties, condo units, or co-op units depending on the property type being appraised and the appraisal form being used. Isolated high and low extremes should be excluded from the range, which means that the predominant price will be that which is the most common or most frequently found in the neighborhood. The appraiser must state the predominant price as a single ﬁgure using whole numbers.
Over-Improvements
An over-improvement is an improvement that is larger or costlier than what is typical for the neighborhood. For example, a 4,000 square foot home located in an area of homes where the typical home is 2,000 square feet may be considered an over-improvement. Furthermore, a home with an in-ground pool in an area where pools are not typical may also be considered an over-improvement. The appraiser must comment on over- improvements and indicate their contributory value in the Sales Comparison Approach adjustment grid.
Improvements can represent an over-improvement for the neighborhood, but still be within the neighborhood price range, such as a property with an in-ground swimming pool, a large addition, or an oversized garage in a market that does not demand these kinds of improvements.
The fact that the property is an over-improvement does not necessarily make the property ineligible. However, lenders must review appraisals on properties with over-improvements that may not be acceptable to the typical purchaser to ensure that only the contributory value of the over-improvement is reﬂected in the appraisal analysis.
Age Range and Predominant Age
The appraiser must indicate the age range and predominant age of properties in the subject's neighborhood. The age range should reﬂect the oldest and newest ages for one-unit properties, two- to four-unit properties, condo units, or co-op units depending on the property type and the appraisal form being used. However, isolated high and low extremes should be excluded from the range. The predominant age is the one that is the most common or most frequently found in the neighborhood. The appraiser must state the predominant age as a single ﬁgure using whole numbers.
When the age of the subject property is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than the predominant age range, the appraiser must explain why the age is outside the range and comment on the marketability of the property and the adjustments that were made in the Sales Comparison Approach adjustment grid to reﬂect that condition.
Present Land Use
Published February 5, 2025
547
Fannie Mae’s appraisal reports provide an area for the appraiser to report the relative percentages of the developed land in the neighborhood when discussing the present land use, rather than simply referring to the zoning classiﬁcations. The appraiser must separately report the percentage of developed one-unit sites and two- to four-unit sites. Undeveloped land must be reported in the “Other” ﬁeld. In addition, if there is a signiﬁcant amount of undeveloped land in the neighborhood, the appraiser must include comments to conﬁrm that they adequately described the neighborhood. If the present land use in the neighborhood is not one of those listed on the appraisal report form, such as parkland, the appraiser also must indicate the type of land use and its related percentage. The total of the types of land uses must equal 100%.
Typically, dwellings best maintain their value when they are situated in neighborhoods that consist of other similar dwellings. However, some factors that are typical of a mixed-use neighborhood, such as easy access to employment centers and a high level of community activity, can actually enhance the market value of the property through increased buyer demand. Neighborhoods may frequently reﬂect a blend of residential and nonresidential land uses.
When diﬀerent land uses and property types are present in a neighborhood, that fact should be considered a neighborhood characteristic that the appraiser needs to take into consideration when performing the neighborhood analysis and deﬁning the neighborhood boundaries. To conﬁrm that any positive or negative eﬀects of the mixed land uses are reﬂected in the sales comparison analysis, the appraiser should select comparable sales from within the same neighborhood whenever possible. If this is not possible, the appraiser may need to make neighborhood or location adjustments to the Sales Comparison Approach adjustment grid for any sales that do not share the same characteristic(s) or externalities.

Introduction This topic contains information on reviewing the Site section of the appraisal report form, including:
Overview
Published February 5, 2025
548
Site Analysis Subject Property Zoning Highest and Best Use Adjoining Properties Site Utilities Oﬀ-Site Improvements Community-Owned or Privately Maintained Streets Special Flood Hazard Areas
Overview
The property site should be of a size, shape, and topography that is generally conforming and acceptable in the market area. It must also have competitive utilities, street improvements, adequate vehicular access, and other amenities (see Property Requirements in B2-3-01, General Property Eligibility for additional information). Because amenities, easements, and encroachments may either detract from or enhance the marketability of a site, the appraiser must reﬂect them in the analysis and evaluation. The appraiser must comment if the site has adverse conditions or if there is market resistance to a property because the site is not compatible with the neighborhood or the requirements of the competitive market, and assess the eﬀect, if any, on the value and marketability of the property.
Site Analysis
The appraisal must include the actual size of the site and not a hypothetical portion of the site for the subject property. For example, the appraiser may not appraise only 5 acres of an unsubdivided 40–acre parcel. The appraised value must reﬂect the entire 40–acre parcel.
Subject Property Zoning
The appraiser must report the speciﬁc zoning class in the appraisal, along with a general statement as to what the zoning permits, such as one- or two-unit, when they indicate a speciﬁc zoning such as R-1 or R-2. The appraisal must indicate whether the subject property presents
a legal conforming use,
a legal non-conforming (grandfathered) use,
an illegal use under the zoning regulations, or
that there is no local zoning.
Fannie Mae only purchases or securitizes mortgage loans on properties if the improvements constitute a legal conforming use of the land. However, Fannie Mae will purchase or securitize a mortgage for a property that constitutes a legal, nonconforming use of the land provided that the appraisal analysis reﬂects any adverse eﬀect that the nonconforming use has on the value and the marketability of the property. This requirement applies to all property types.
Fannie Mae will not purchase or securitize a mortgage secured by a property that is subject to certain land-use

regulations, such as coastal tideland or wetland laws, that create setback lines or other provisions that prevent the reconstruction or maintenance of the property improvements if they are damaged or destroyed. The intent of these types of land-use regulations is to remove existing land uses and to stop land development, including the maintenance or construction of seawalls, within speciﬁc setback lines.
For information regarding accessory units that comply or do not comply with zoning, see B4-1.3-05, Improvements Section of the Appraisal Report.
Highest and Best Use
Fannie Mae will only purchase or securitize a mortgage that represents the highest and best use of the site as improved. If the current improvements clearly do not represent the highest and best use of the site as an improved site, it must be indicated on the appraisal report.
The appraiser determines highest and best use of a site as the reasonable and probable use that supports the highest present value on the eﬀective date of the appraisal. For improvements to represent the highest and best use of a site, they must be legally permitted, ﬁnancially feasible, and physically possible, and must provide more proﬁt than any other use of the site would generate. All of those criteria must be met if the improvements are to be considered as the highest and best use of a site.
The appraiser’s highest and best use analysis of the subject property should consider the property as it is improved. This treatment recognizes that the existing improvements should continue in use until it is ﬁnancially feasible to remove the dwelling and build a new one, or to renovate the existing dwelling. If the use of comparable sales demonstrates that the improvements are reasonably typical and compatible with market demand for the neighborhood, and the present improvements contribute to the value of the subject property so that its value is greater than the estimated vacant site value, the appraiser should consider the existing use as reasonable and report it as the highest and best use.
Adjoining Properties
The appraiser must consider the present or anticipated use of any adjoining property that may adversely aﬀect the value or marketability of the subject property.
Site Utilities
For mortgage loans to be eligible for purchase or securitization, the utilities of the property must meet community standards. If public sewer and/or water facilities, those that are supplied and regulated by the local government, are not available, community or private well and septic facilities must be available and utilized by the subject property. The owners of the subject property must have the right to access those facilities, which must be viable on an ongoing basis. Private well or septic facilities must be located on the subject site, unless the subject property has the right to access oﬀ-site private facilities and there is an adequate, legally binding agreement for access and maintenance.
If there is market resistance to an area because of environmental hazards or any other conditions that aﬀect well, septic, or public water facilities, the appraisal must address the eﬀect of the hazards on the value and marketability of the subject property (see B4-1.4-08, Environmental Hazards Appraisal Requirements).
Published February 5, 2025

Oﬀ-Site Improvements
Oﬀ-site improvements include, but are not limited to, streets, alleys, sidewalks, curbs and gutters, and street lights. The subject property should front on a publicly dedicated and maintained street that meets community standards and is generally accepted by area residents. If a property fronts on a street that is not typical of those found in the community, the appraiser must address the eﬀect of that location on the value and marketability of the subject property.
The presence of sidewalks, curbs and gutters, street lights, and alleys depends on local custom. If they are typical in the community, they should be present on the subject site. The appraiser must comment on any adverse conditions and address their eﬀect on the value and marketability of the subject property.
Community-Owned or Privately Maintained Streets
If the property is located on a community-owned or privately-owned and maintained street, an adequate, legally enforceable agreement or covenant for maintenance of the street is required. The agreement or covenant should include the following provisions and be recorded in the land records of the appropriate jurisdiction:
responsibility for payment of repairs, including each party’s representative share;
default remedies in the event a party to the agreement or covenant fails to comply with their obligations; and
the eﬀective term of the agreement or covenant, which in most cases should be perpetual and binding on any future owners.
Note: If the property is located within a state that has statutory provisions that deﬁne the responsibilities of property owners for the maintenance and repair of a private street, no separate agreement or covenant is required.
If the property is not located in a state that imposes statutory requirements for maintenance, and either there is no agreement or covenant for maintenance of the street, or an agreement or covenant exists but does not meet the requirements listed above, the lender may still deliver the loan. However, the lender is required to indemnify Fannie Mae (as described in A2-1-03, Indemniﬁcation for Losses) against all losses incurred by Fannie Mae as a result of the physical condition of the street or in order to establish and/or retain access to the street.
Special Flood Hazard Areas
Fannie Mae’s appraisal report forms provide an area for the appraiser to indicate whether the property is located in a Special Flood Hazard Area that is identiﬁed on the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps. The appraiser must also indicate the speciﬁc FEMA ﬂood zone and the map number and its eﬀective date. For additional information concerning Fannie Mae’s policies on ﬂood insurance, see B7-3-06, Flood Insurance Requirements for All Property Types.

Introduction This topic contains information on reviewing the Improvements section of the appraisal report form, including:
Overview Conformity of Improvements to Neighborhood Unique Housing Types Actual and Eﬀective Ages Remaining Economic Life Energy Eﬃcient Improvements Layout and Floor Plans Gross Living Area Gross Building Area Accessory Dwelling Units Additions without Permits Properties with Outbuildings
Overview
The appraisal must provide a clear, detailed, and accurate description of the improvements. The description must be as speciﬁc as possible, commenting on such things as needed repairs, additional features, and modernization, and should provide supporting addenda, if necessary. If the subject property has an accessory dwelling unit, the appraisal should describe it.
Conformity of Improvements to Neighborhood
The improvements should conform to the neighborhood in terms of age, type, design, and materials used for their construction. If there is market resistance to a property because its improvements are not compatible with the neighborhood or with the requirements of the competitive market because of adequacy of plumbing, heating, or electrical services; design; quality; size; condition; or any other reason directly related to market demand, the appraiser must address the impact to the value and marketability of the subject property. However, the lender should be aware that many older neighborhoods have favorable heterogeneity in architectural styles, land use, and age of housing. For example, older neighborhoods are especially likely to have been developed through custom building. This variety may be a positive marketing factor.
Unique Housing Types
In the appraisal and appraisal report review processes, special consideration must be given to properties that represent unique housing for the subject neighborhood. Mortgages secured by unique or nontraditional types of housing, including, but not limited to, earth houses, geodesic domes, and log houses, are eligible for sale to
Published February 5, 2025

Fannie Mae provided the appraiser has adequate information to develop a reliable opinion of market value. It is not necessary for one or more of the comparable sales to be of the same design and appeal as the property that is being appraised, although appraisal accuracy is enhanced by using comparable sales that are the most similar to the subject property. On a case-by-case basis, both the appraiser and the underwriter must independently determine whether there is suﬃcient information available to develop a reliable opinion of market value. This will depend on the extent of the diﬀerences between the special or unique property and the more traditional types of houses in the neighborhood and the number of such properties that have already been sold in the neighborhood.
A 3D printed home with a traditional design and constructed using conventional building materials is not considered a unique or nontraditional housing type. Lenders should follow the standard eligibility and comparable sales selection requirements for site-built housing. See B4-1.3-08, Comparable Sales and B4-1.3-09, Adjustments to Comparable Sales, for additional information. To identify this construction method, the appraiser must enter "3D Printed Home" in the bottom free-form description ﬁeld of the Sales Comparison Approach grid in the appraisal for the subject property and comparable sales (if applicable).
When appraising unique properties,
if the appraiser cannot locate recent comparable sales of the same design and appeal, but is able to determine sound adjustments for the diﬀerences between the comparables that are available and the subject property and demonstrate the marketability of the property based on older comparable sales, comparable sales in competing neighborhoods, the existence of similar properties in the market area, and any other reliable market data, the property is acceptable as security for a mortgage deliverable to Fannie Mae;
if the appraiser is not able to ﬁnd any evidence of market acceptance, and the characteristics of the property are so signiﬁcantly diﬀerent that they cannot establish a reliable opinion of market value, the property is not acceptable as security for a mortgage deliverable to Fannie Mae.
Fannie Mae does not specify minimum size or living area requirements for properties with the exception of manufactured housing (see B4-1.4-01, Factory-Built Housing: Manufactured Housing). There should be comparables of similar size to the subject property to support the general acceptability of a particular property type.
Actual and Eﬀective Ages
Fannie Mae does not place a restriction on the actual age of the dwelling. Older dwellings that meet Fannie Mae’s general requirements are acceptable. Improvements for all properties must be of the quality and condition that will be acceptable to typical purchasers in the subject neighborhood.
The relationship between the actual and eﬀective ages of the property is a good indication of its condition. A property that has been well-maintained generally will have an eﬀective age somewhat lower than its actual age. On the other hand, a property that has an eﬀective age higher than its actual age probably has not been well- maintained or may have a particular physical problem. In such cases, the lender should pay particular attention to the condition of the subject property in its review of any appraisal report. When the appraiser makes adjustments for the “Year Built,” they must explain the adjustments that were made.
Remaining Economic Life
Published February 5, 2025
553
Fannie Mae does not have any requirements related to the remaining economic life of the property. However, related property deﬁciencies must be discussed in the sections of the appraisal report that address the improvements analysis and comments on the condition of the property.
Fannie Mae’s appraisal report forms are designed to meet the needs of several diﬀerent user groups; consequently, the report forms address the remaining economic life for the property being appraised. However, appraisers are not required to report this information. If appraisers report this information, lenders do not need to consider remaining economic life because any related property deﬁciencies will be discussed in the sections of the appraisal report that address the improvements analysis and comments on the condition of the property.
Energy Eﬃcient Improvements
An energy-eﬃcient property is one that uses resource-eﬀective design, materials, building systems, and site orientation to conserve nonrenewable fuels.
Special energy-saving items must be recognized in the appraisal process and noted on the appraisal report form. For example, when completing the appraisal report (Form 1004), special energy-eﬃcient items are to be addressed in the Improvements section in the Additional features ﬁeld. The nature of these items and their contribution to value will vary throughout the country because of climactic conditions, diﬀerences in utility costs, and overall market reaction to the cost of the feature. Some examples of special energy-eﬃcient features may include, but are not limited to, energy eﬃcient ratings or certiﬁcations, programmable thermostats, solar photovoltaic systems, solar panels, low-e windows, insulated ducts, and tank-less water heaters.
Appraisers must compare energy-eﬃcient features of the subject property to those of comparable properties in the Sales Comparison Approach adjustment grid. Appraisers may augment the Sales Comparison Approach in evaluating any impact (either positive or negative) to the value of energy eﬃciency improvements with either the income or cost approach; however, appraisers cannot adjust the value of the property
on a mechanical dollar-for-dollar basis based on equipment and installation cost, or the discounted present value of expected cost savings of the equipment over the useful life of the equipment; or
solely based on the cost or income approach. The appraiser must also analyze the market reaction to the energy eﬃcient feature.
Solar panels that are leased from or owned by a third party under a power purchase agreement or other similar ﬁnancing arrangement must be considered personal property and not be included in the appraised value of the property. See B2-3-04, Special Property Eligibility Considerations, for additional eligibility requirements for properties with solar panels.
Layout and Floor Plans
Dwellings with unusual layouts and ﬂoor plans generally have limited market appeal. A review of the room list and ﬂoor plan for the dwelling unit may indicate an unusual layout, such as bedrooms on a level with no bath, or a kitchen on a diﬀerent level from the dining room. If the appraiser indicates that such inadequacies will result in market resistance to the subject property, they must make appropriate adjustments to reﬂect this in the overall analysis. However, if market acceptance can be demonstrated through the use of comparable sales with the same inadequacies, no adjustments are required.
Published February 5, 2025

Gross Living Area
Appraisers must follow the Square Footage-Method for Calculating: ANSI® Z765-2021 ("ANSI standard") when measuring, calculating and reporting the gross living area and non-gross living areas (basement, additional structures, etc.) of the subject property for most property types. Appraisals requiring interior and exterior inspections must follow this standard; appraisals of this type performed without using this standard will not be acceptable.
Note: The ANSI standard cannot be used to measure apartment-style units in condo or co-op projects; however, it must be used for any non-apartment style dwellings including townhomes, rowhouses, and other detached single-family homes. When measuring apartment-style units in condo, or co-op projects; the appraiser should use interior perimeter measurements. The ANSI standard also does not apply to two- to four-unit properties.
The most common comparison for one-unit properties, including units in PUD, condo, or co-op projects, is above- grade gross living area and below-grade square footage. The appraiser must be consistent when reporting the ﬁnished above-grade gross living area, below-grade square footage, and room count. The need for consistency also applies from report to report. For example, when using the same transaction as a comparable sale in multiple reports, the room count and gross living area must not change.
When using sketching or 3D scanning software, the resulting output must also conform to the ANSI standard. See Exhibits for Appraisals in B4-1.2-01, Appraisal Report Forms and Exhibits for additional information on sketches and ﬂoor plans.
Only ﬁnished above-grade areas can be used in calculating and reporting of above-grade room count and square footage for the gross living area. Fannie Mae considers a level to be below-grade if any portion of it is below-grade, regardless of the quality of its ﬁnish or the window area of any room. Therefore, a walk-out basement with ﬁnished rooms would not be included in the above-grade room count. Rooms that are not included in the above-grade room count may add substantially to the value of a property, particularly when the quality of the ﬁnish is high. For that reason, the appraiser should report the basement or other partially below- grade areas separately and make appropriate adjustments for them on the Basement & Finished Rooms Below- Grade line in the Sales Comparison Approach adjustment grid.
Detached structures with ﬁnished square footage must be reported on a diﬀerent line in the adjustment grid and not included as part of the subject's reported gross living area.
When the subject property has an area that does not meet the ANSI minimum ceiling height requirements, the additional square footage must be reported on an additional line in the adjustment grid and an appropriate market adjustment applied, if warranted. Additionally, the appraiser must provide and explanation in the report for how this area was handled in order to comply with the ANSI standard and also acknowledge any contribution of the additional square footage.
If the appraiser is unable to adhere to the ANSI standard they must enter "GXX001-" at the beginning of the Additional Features ﬁeld of the appraisal and provide an explanation of why they were not able to comply. For example, the appraiser is performing an appraisal in a state that requires adherence to a diﬀerent measuring standard. Such loans may still be eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae.
Gross Building Area
Published February 5, 2025
555
The gross building area
is the total ﬁnished area including any interior common areas, such as stairways and hallways of the improvements based on exterior measurements;
is the most common comparison for two- to four-unit properties;
must be consistently developed for the subject property and all comparables used in the appraisal;
must include all ﬁnished above-grade and below-grade living areas, counting all interior common areas such as stairways, hallways, storage rooms; and
cannot count exterior common areas, such as open stairways.
Fannie Mae will accept the use of other comparisons for two- to four-unit properties, such as the total above- grade and below-grade areas discussed in Gross Living Area, provided the appraiser
explains the reasons they did not use a gross building area comparison, and
clearly describes the comparisons that were made.
Accessory Dwelling Units
An ADU is generally an additional living area independent of the primary dwelling that may have been added to, created within, or detached from the primary dwelling. The ADU must have basic requirements for living, sleeping, cooking, and bathroom facilities on the same parcel as the primary dwelling. See B2-3-04, Special Property Eligibility Considerations, for complete ADU eligibility requirements.
When reporting the living area of an ADU, it should not be included with the Gross Living Area calculation of the primary dwelling. It should be reported and adjusted for on a separate line in the grid, unless the ADU is contained within or part of the primary dwelling with interior access and above grade. If a standalone structure does not meet the ADU minimum requirements, it should be treated as any other ancillary structure and included as a separate line item in the sales comparison approach then adjusted based on its contributory value to the subject property.
Whether a property is deﬁned as a one-unit property with an ADU or a two- to four-unit property will be based on the characteristics of the property, which may include, but are not limited to, the existence of separate utility meter(s), a unique postal address, and whether the unit can be legally rented. The appraiser must determine compliance with this deﬁnition as part of the analysis in the Highest and Best Use section of the appraisal. When there is an ADU, the appraisal report must include a description of the ADU and analysis of any eﬀect it has on the value or marketability of the subject property. The appraisal report must demonstrate that the improvements are acceptable for the market. An aged settled sale will qualify as a comparable, and an active listing or under contract sale will qualify as a supplemental exhibit to show marketability.
Zoning for an ADU
If it is determined that the property contains an ADU that is not allowed under zoning (where an ADU is not allowed under any circumstance), the property is eligible under the following additional conditions:
The lender conﬁrms that the existence will not jeopardize any future property insurance claim that might need to be ﬁled for the property.

The appraisal report states that the improvements represent a use that does not comply with zoning (“illegal” use).
The appraisal report demonstrates that the improvements are typical for the market through an analysis of at least two comparable sales with the same non-compliant zoning use. Aged settled sale(s) with the same non-compliant zoning use are acceptable if recent sales are not available. At a minimum, the appraisal report must include a total of three settled sales.
See B4-1.3-04, Site Section of the Appraisal Report, for subject property zoning information.
Additions without Permits
If the appraiser identiﬁes an addition(s) that does not have the required permit, the appraiser must comment on the quality and appearance of the work and its impact, if any, on the market value of the subject property.
Properties with Outbuildings
A lender must give properties with outbuildings special consideration in the appraisal report review to ensure that the property is residential in nature. Descriptions of the outbuildings should be reported in the Improvements and Sales Comparison Approach sections of the appraisal report form.
Type of Outbuilding
Acceptability
Minimal outbuildings, such as small barns or
stables, that are of relatively insigniﬁcant value in

Appraiser Selection of Condition, Quality, and other Characteristic Ratings
The condition and quality ratings must be based on a holistic view of the property and any improvements. When selecting the condition and quality ratings, an appraiser must
consider all improvements to determine an overall condition and quality rating. The appraiser should select the rating that best reﬂects the property as a whole and in its entirety.
Published February 5, 2025

describe the subject property as of the eﬀective date of the appraisal on an absolute basis, meaning the property must be rated on its own merits. The rating should not be selected on a relative basis, meaning it is not selected on how the property relates or compares to other properties in the neighborhood. Additionally, the condition and quality ratings for comparable properties must be made on an absolute basis (again, each comparative property on its own merits), not on a relative basis, and reﬂect the property as of the date of sale of that comparable property.
Note: These requirements also apply to all other ratings or descriptions, including the View and Location.
When an appraiser selects a rating and/or description of the subject property for a sales transaction, the selected rating and/or description must remain the same when reﬂecting that speciﬁc transaction. For example, if a C4 rating is selected for the sale of the subject property, then that property remains a C4 when using that speciﬁc sale as a comparable in future reports. The same expectation holds true for ratings and descriptions of comparable sales. When a comparable is used in a subsequent appraisal, the ratings and descriptions of that property should not change from one appraisal to the next when it reﬂects the same sale transaction.
Note: Properties can have the same rating or description and still require an adjustment. It should be noted that this does not only apply to condition and quality ratings and can apply to other ratings or descriptions as well. For example, all water views may not be equal. In this instance, an adjustment should be made and explained in the Additional Comments section of the form or in an addendum.
Property Condition
Lenders must take the necessary steps to conﬁrm that a property meets Fannie Mae’s condition requirements as outlined in this topic.
The table below provides the requirements for property condition.
✓
Requirements
The appraisal report must express an opinion about the condition of the improvements based
on the factual data of the improvements analysis.
Appraisals based on interior and exterior inspections must include complete visual inspections
of the accessible areas of the property.
Note: Appraisers are not responsible for hidden or unapparent conditions.
Appraisal reports must reﬂect adverse conditions that were apparent during the inspection or
discovered while performing research, such as, but not limited to, needed repairs,
deterioration, or the presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, or adverse
environmental conditions.
Published February 5, 2025
559
✓
Requirements
Detrimental conditions of the improvements must be reported in the appraisal even if the
conditions are typical for competing properties.
The appraiser must consider and describe the overall condition and quality and condition of
the property improvements. (See Identifying Property Condition; Deﬁnitions of Not Updated,
Updated, and Remodeled; and Identifying Quality of Construction in this topic for details.)
The appraiser must identify
items that require immediate repair; and
items where maintenance may have been deferred, which may or may not require
immediate repair.
The appraisal Additional Comments section must address needed repairs and physical,
functional, or external inadequacies.
Property Condition Ratings
For appraisals required to be completed with the UAD, the appraiser must assign one of the following standardized condition ratings in the table below when identifying the condition of the improvements for the subject property and comparable sales.
Rating
Description
The improvements have been very recently constructed and have not previously been
occupied. The entire structure and all components are new and the dwelling features no
physical depreciation.
Note: Newly constructed improvements that feature recycled materials and/or components
C1
can be considered new dwellings provided that the dwelling is placed on a 100 percent new
foundation and the recycled materials and the recycled components have been
rehabilitated/re-manufactured into like-new condition. Improvements that have not been
previously occupied are not considered “new” if they have any signiﬁcant physical
depreciation (that is, newly constructed dwellings that have been vacant for an extended
period of time without adequate maintenance or upkeep).
Published February 5, 2025
560
Rating
Description
The improvements feature no deferred maintenance, little or no physical depreciation, and
require no repairs. Virtually all building components are new or have been recently
repaired, reﬁnished, or rehabilitated. All outdated components and ﬁnishes have been
updated and/or replaced with components that meet current standards. Dwellings in this
C2
category either are almost new or have been recently completely renovated and are similar
in condition to new construction.
Note: The improvements represent a relatively new property that is well-maintained with
no deferred maintenance and little or no physical depreciation, or an older property that
has been recently completely renovated.
The improvements are well-maintained and feature limited physical depreciation due to
normal wear and tear. Some components, but not every major building component, may be
updated or recently rehabilitated. The structure has been well-maintained.
C3
Note: The improvement is in its ﬁrst-cycle of replacing short-lived building components
(appliances, ﬂoor coverings, HVAC, etc.) and is being well– maintained. Its estimated
eﬀective age is less than its actual age. It also may reﬂect a property in which the majority
of short-lived building components have been replaced but not to the level of a complete
renovation.
The improvements feature some minor deferred maintenance and physical deterioration
due to normal wear and tear. The dwelling has been adequately maintained and requires
only minimal repairs to building components/mechanical systems and cosmetic repairs. All
major building components have been adequately maintained and are functionally
C4
adequate.
Note: The estimated eﬀective age may be close to or equal to its actual age. It reﬂects a
property in which some of the short-lived building components have been replaced, and
some short-lived building components are at or near the end of their physical life
expectancy; however, they still function adequately. Most minor repairs have been
addressed on an ongoing basis resulting in an adequately maintained property.
The improvements feature obvious deferred maintenance and are in need of some
signiﬁcant repairs. Some building components need repairs, rehabilitation, or updating. The
functional utility and overall livability are somewhat diminished due to condition, but the
C5
dwelling remains useable and functional as a residence.
Note: Some signiﬁcant repairs are needed to the improvements due to the lack of
adequate maintenance. It reﬂects a property in which many of its short-lived building
components are at the end of or have exceeded their physical life expectancy, but remain
functional.
Published February 5, 2025
561
Rating
Description
The improvements have substantial damage or deferred maintenance with deﬁciencies or
defects that are severe enough to aﬀect the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the
improvements. The improvements are in need of substantial repairs and rehabilitation,
C6
including many or most major components.
Note: Substantial repairs are needed to the improvements due to the lack of adequate
maintenance or property damage. It reﬂects a property with conditions severe enough to
aﬀect the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the improvements.
Identifying Property Condition
As previously noted, the condition rating selected for the property must reﬂect a holistic view of the condition of the property improvements. It would be inappropriate to select either a lower or higher overall rating on the basis of one or two minor inferior or superior areas of the property improvements. However, the C6 rating is an exception because it indicates that the property is impacted by one or more deﬁciencies that negatively aﬀect the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the property. As a result, if any portion of the dwelling is rated a C6, the whole dwelling must be rated a C6.
Properties with a condition rating of C6 are not eligible for sale to Fannie Mae. Any deﬁciencies impacting the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the property must be repaired with a resulting minimum condition rating of C5 prior to delivery of the loan. See Physical Deﬁciencies That Aﬀect Safety, Soundness, or Structural Integrity of the Subject Property in this topic for information related to completing appraisals on properties with safety, soundness, or structural integrity deﬁciencies.
Deﬁnitions of Not Updated, Updated, and Remodeled
For appraisals required to be completed using the UAD, as a subset of identifying the condition of the subject property, the appraiser must also identify the level of updating, if any, that the subject property has received by utilizing the deﬁnitions in the table below.
Level of Updating
Description
Little or no updating or modernization. This description includes, but is not limited to, new
homes.
Residential properties of ﬁfteen years of age or less often reﬂect an original condition with
Not
no updating, if no major components have been replaced or updated. Those over ﬁfteen
Updated
years of age are also considered not updated if the appliances, ﬁxtures, and ﬁnishes are
predominantly dated. An area that is ‘Not Updated’ may still be well-maintained and fully
functional, and this rating does not necessarily imply deferred maintenance or
physical/functional deterioration.
Published February 5, 2025
562
Level of Updating
Description
The area of the home has been modiﬁed to meet current market expectations. These
modiﬁcations are limited in terms of both scope and cost.
Updated
An updated area of the home should have an improved look and feel, or functional utility.
Changes that constitute updates include refurbishment and/or replacing components to
meet existing market expectations. Updates do not include signiﬁcant alterations to the
existing structure.
Signiﬁcant ﬁnish and/or structural changes have been made that increase utility and
appeal through complete replacement and/or expansion.
A remodeled area reﬂects fundamental changes that include multiple alterations. These
Remodeled
alterations may include some or all of the following: replacement of a major component
(cabinet(s), bathtub, or bathroom tile), relocation of plumbing/gas ﬁxtures/appliances,
signiﬁcant structural alterations (relocating walls, and/or the addition of square footage).
This would include a complete gutting and rebuild.
Appraisals Completed “As Is”
Fannie Mae permits appraisals to be based on the “as is” condition of the property provided existing conditions are minor and do not aﬀect the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the property, and the appraiser’s opinion of value reﬂects the existence of these conditions.
Minor conditions and deferred maintenance are typically due to normal wear and tear from the aging process and the occupancy of the property. While such conditions generally do not rise to the level of a required repair, they must be reported. Examples of minor conditions and deferred maintenance include worn ﬂoor ﬁnishes or carpet, minor plumbing leaks, holes in window screens, missing handrails, or cracked window glass.
Properties with condition ratings C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 as previously deﬁned are eligible in “as is” condition. Properties with the initial Condition Rating C6 indicate one or more deﬁciencies that impact the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the property. Therefore, the appraisal must be completed "subject to" completion of the deﬁcient item(s) with a minimum resulting condition rating of C5.
See Physical Deﬁciencies That Aﬀect Safety, Soundness, or Structural Integrity of the Subject Property in this topic for additional details when completing appraisals on properties with safety, soundness, or structural integrity deﬁciencies.
Quality of Construction Rating
For appraisals required to be completed using the UAD, the appraiser must assign one of the following standardized quality ratings in the table below when identifying the quality of construction for the subject property and comparable sales.
Published February 5, 2025

Description
Dwellings with this quality rating are usually unique structures that are individually
designed by an architect for a speciﬁed user. Such residences typically are constructed
from detailed architectural plans and speciﬁcations and feature an exceptionally high level
Q1
of workmanship and exceptionally high-grade materials throughout the interior and exterior
of the structure. The design features exceptionally high-quality exterior reﬁnements and
ornamentation, and exceptionally high-quality interior reﬁnements. The workmanship,
materials, and ﬁnishes throughout the dwelling are of exceptionally high quality.
Dwellings with this quality rating are often custom designed for construction on an
individual property owner’s site. However, dwellings in this quality grade are also found in
Q2
high-quality tract developments featuring residences constructed from individual plans or
from highly modiﬁed or upgraded plans. The design features detailed, high-quality exterior
ornamentation, high-quality interior reﬁnements, and detail. The workmanship, materials,

Rating
Description
Dwellings with this quality rating are of basic quality and lower cost; some may not be
suitable for year-round occupancy. Such dwellings are often built with simple plans or
without plans, often utilizing the lowest quality building materials. Such dwellings are often
Q6
built or expanded by persons who are professionally unskilled or possess only minimal
construction skills. Electrical, plumbing, and other mechanical systems and equipment may
be minimal or nonexistent. Older dwellings may feature one or more substandard or
nonconforming additions to the original structure.
Identifying Quality of Construction
The same approach used in identifying the condition of the property is also applicable to identifying the quality of construction. The selected rating must reﬂect a holistic view of the quality of construction. However, the Q6 Rating is an exception because it indicates that the property is impacted by one or more deﬁciencies that negatively aﬀect the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the property. As a result, if any portion of the dwelling is rated a Q6, the whole dwelling must be rated a Q6.
Properties with a quality of construction rating of Q6 are eligible for sale to Fannie Mae provided any items in relation to the quality of construction that impact the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the property are repaired prior to the delivery of the loan. See Physical Deﬁciencies That Aﬀect Safety, Soundness, or Structural Integrity of the Subject Property in this topic for requirements when completing appraisals on properties with safety, soundness, or structural integrity deﬁciencies.
Physical Deﬁciencies That Aﬀect Safety, Soundness, or Structural Integrity of the Subject Property
The appraisal report must identify and describe physical deﬁciencies that could aﬀect a property’s safety, soundness, or structural integrity. If the appraiser has identiﬁed any of these deﬁciencies, the property must be appraised "subject to" completion of the speciﬁc repairs or alterations. In these instances, the property condition and quality ratings must reﬂect the condition and quality of the property based on the hypothetical condition that the repairs or alterations have been completed.
If the appraiser is not qualiﬁed to evaluate the alterations or repairs, the appraisal must note the deﬁciencies and be completed "subject to" a satisfactory inspection by a qualiﬁed professional. The lender must decide if the inspection(s) is required and whether the property meets eligibility requirements. If the property does not meet eligibility requirements, the lender must provide satisfactory evidence that the condition has been corrected or repaired prior to loan delivery. In this case, the appraiser is not required to review the professionally prepared report, re-inspect the property, or provide a Form 1004D. The lender must document the decision and rationale in the loan ﬁle. See B4-1.4-08, Environmental Hazards Appraisal Requirements, for properties aﬀected by environmental hazards.
Infestation, Dampness, or Settlement
Published February 5, 2025
565
If the appraisal indicates evidence of infestation (such as, wood-boring insects), dampness, or abnormal settlement, the appraisal must comment on the eﬀect on the value and marketability of the subject property. The lender must either provide satisfactory evidence that the condition was corrected or submit a professionally prepared report indicating, based on an inspection of the property, that the condition does not pose any threat of structural damage to the improvements. The appraisal should be made "subject to" repairs or alternations, or "subject to" an inspection by a qualiﬁed professional.

Introduction This topic contains information on reviewing the Sales Comparison Approach section of the appraisal report form, including:
Overview Data and Veriﬁcation Sources of Comparable Sales Prior Sales History of the Subject and Comparable Sales
Overview
The sales comparison approach to value is an analysis of comparable sales, contract sales, and listings of properties that are the most comparable to the subject property.
The appraiser’s analysis of a property must take into consideration all factors that have an eﬀect on value. The appraiser must analyze all closed sales, contract sales, and oﬀerings or listings of properties that are the most comparable to the subject property in order to identify any signiﬁcant diﬀerences or elements of comparison that could aﬀect their opinion of value for the subject property as of the eﬀective date of the appraisal report. This is particularly important in changing (increasing or declining values) markets. Analyzing closed sales, contract sales, and oﬀerings or listings is an important analysis in any market and will result in more accurate reporting on market conditions, including trends that indicate that sale prices for contract sales and asking prices for recent oﬀerings or listings have changed. (Also see B4-1.3-03, Neighborhood Section of the Appraisal
Published February 5, 2025
566
Report, for information regarding Trend of Neighborhood Property Values, Demand/Supply, and Marketing Time.)
Data and Veriﬁcation Sources of Comparable Sales
Data and veriﬁcation source(s) for each comparable sale must be reported on the appraisal report form. Examples of data sources include, but are not limited to, a multiple listing service, deed records, tax records, real estate agents, builders, appraisers, appraiser’s ﬁles, and other third party sources and vendors. The appraiser must state the speciﬁc data source (such as tax records or deed records), and refrain from using broad categories, such as “public records.” Data source(s) must be reliable sources for the area where the subject property is located.
Examples of veriﬁcation sources include, but are not limited to, the buyer, seller, listing agent, selling agent, and closing documents in certain situations. Regardless of the source(s) used, there must be suﬃcient data to understand the conditions of sale, existence of ﬁnancing concessions, physical characteristics of the subject property, and whether it was an arms-length transaction.
It is acceptable to obtain comparable sales data from parties that have a ﬁnancial interest in either the sale or ﬁnancing of the subject property; however, the appraiser must verify the data with a party that does not have a ﬁnancial interest in the subject transaction. For example, if the real estate agent of the subject property has provided comparable sales data, that information must be veriﬁed through another disinterested source.
Prior Sales History of the Subject and Comparable Sales
Fannie Mae’s appraisal report forms require the appraiser to report the three year subject property and twelve month comparable sales history.

Published February 5, 2025

Selection of Comparable Sales
The appraiser is responsible for determining which comparables are the best and most appropriate for the assignment. Fannie Mae expects the appraiser to account for all factors that aﬀect value when completing the analysis. Comparable sales should have similar physical and legal characteristics when compared to the subject property. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, site, room count, gross living area, style, and condition. External factors, including Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) designated ﬂood zone, should be given consideration when selecting comparables.
When choosing comparable sales, the appraiser should examine the market area of the subject property, assess its characteristics, and identify similar comparable sales. Market area is deﬁned as the geographic region, for a subject property, from which most demand comes and in which most of the competition is located. This does not mean comparable sales must be identical to the subject property, but instead should be competitive and appeal to the same market participants that would also consider purchasing the subject property. If the available comparable sales are not similar, the appraiser needs to decide whether an expansion of the market area search is appropriate. If this occurs, the appraiser must provide commentary to explain the rationale for selecting comparable sales outside the subject's market area and make location adjustments if warranted.
Comparable sales from within the same market area (including subdivision or project) as the subject property should be used when possible, and must be used in certain instances (see below). Sale activity from within the neighborhood is the best indicator of value as sales prices of comparable properties from the same location should reﬂect the same positive and negative location characteristics.
Fannie Mae does allow for the use of comparable sales located in competing market areas, as these may simply be the best comparables available and the most appropriate for the appraiser’s analysis. If this situation arises, the appraiser must not expand the neighborhood boundaries just to encompass the comparables selected. The appraiser must indicate the comparables are from a competing neighborhood and address any diﬀerences that exist. The appraiser must also provide an explanation as to why they used the speciﬁc comparable sales in the appraisal report and include a discussion of how a competing neighborhood is comparable to the subject's neighborhood.
If a property is located in an area in which there is a shortage of truly comparable sales, either because of the nature of the property improvements or the relatively low number of sales transactions in the neighborhood, the appraiser might need to use properties that are not truly comparable to the subject property. In some situations, properties that are not truly comparable may simply be the best available and the most appropriate for the appraiser’s analysis. The use of such sales is acceptable if the appraiser adequately documents the analysis and explains why they were used. (For additional information, see B4-1.3-03, Neighborhood Section of the Appraisal Report.
When describing the proximity of the comparable sale to the subject property, the appraiser must be speciﬁc with respect to the distance in terms of miles and include the applicable directional indicator (for example, “1.75 miles NW”). The distance between the subject property and each comparable property is to be measured using a straight line between the properties.
Minimum Number of Comparable Sales
A minimum of three closed comparables must be reported in the sales comparison approach. Additional comparable sales may be reported to support the opinion of market value provided by the appraiser. The
Published February 5, 2025
568
subject property can be used as a fourth comparable sale or as supporting data if it was previously closed. Contract oﬀerings and current listings can be used as supporting data, if appropriate. See Additional Requirements for New (or Recently Converted) Condos, Subdivisions, or PUDs below for exceptions to this policy.
In no instance may the appraiser create comparable sales by combining vacant land sales with the contract purchase price of a home (improvements only). While these transactions cannot be used to meet the required minimum three closed comparables, these transactions, which are often completed as part of a construction-to- permanent loan transaction, may be included as additional support with appropriate commentary.
Age of the Comparable Sales
Comparable sales that have closed within the last 12 months should be used in the appraisal; however, the best and most appropriate comparable sales may not always be the most recent sales. For example, it may be appropriate for the appraiser to use a nine month old sale with a time adjustment rather than a one month old sale that requires multiple adjustments. An older sale may be more appropriate in situations when market conditions have aﬀected the availability of recent sales, and the changing market conditions causing their use must be explained in the report.
Additionally, older comparable sales that are the best indicator of value for the subject property can be used if appropriate. For example, if the subject property is located in a rural area that has minimal sales activity, the appraiser may not be able to locate three truly comparable sales that sold in the last 12 months. In this case, the appraiser may use older comparable sales if they explain why they are being used.
Additional Requirements for New (or Recently Converted) Condos, Subdivisions, or PUDS
If the subject property is located in a new (or recently converted) condo project, subdivision, or PUD, it must be compared to other properties in the same market area and to properties within the subject condo project, subdivision, or PUD. This comparison should help demonstrate market acceptance of new developments and the properties within them. Generally, a subdivision is considered new when there are limited or no resales or the builder or developer is involved in the marketing or sale of the properties. See B4-2.1-01, General Information on Project Standards and B4-2.3-01, Eligibility Requirements for Units in PUD Projects for the deﬁnition of a new condo project or PUD.
At a minimum, the appraisal report for these properties must include the following:
At least one settled comparable sale from the subject condo project, subdivision, or PUD. (A resale is preferable if it is veriﬁable and does not involve the subject builder or developer). At least one settled comparable sale from outside the subject condo project, subdivision, or PUD. A third settled comparable sale can be from inside or outside of the subject condo project, subdivision, or PUD. Settled comparable sales or resales from within the subject condo project, subdivision, or PUD are preferable to settled sales from outside the condo project, subdivision, or PUD provided the builder or developer of the subject property is not involved in those transactions. In the event there are no settled comparable sales inside a new condo project, subdivision, or PUD because the subject property transaction is one of the ﬁrst units to sell, the appraiser may use two pending sales in the subject project, subdivision, or PUD in lieu of one settled sale. The appraiser must
Published February 5, 2025
569
also use at least three settled comparable sales from projects, subdivisions, or PUDs outside of the subject project, subdivision, or PUD.
If the subject property is part of a newly built or recently converted condo project, subdivision, or PUD that has 2-20 units and there are no settled or pending sales, the appraiser may use comparable sales from a competing project, subdivision, or PUD. The requirements in the following table apply.
✓
The appraisal report must...
Use competing projects, subdivisions, or PUDs of a similar size and type.
Explain why the comparable sales were chosen and demonstrate market acceptance.
Describe how the condo project, subdivision, or PUD chosen compares to the subject
property.
Note: If the subject property is not the ﬁrst unit under contract in the condo project, subdivision, or PUD, the appraiser must include one under contract sale from the subject's project, subdivision, or PUD as a supplemental exhibit.
To meet the requirement that the appraiser utilize one comparable sale from inside the subject project, subdivision, or PUD, the appraiser may need to rely solely on the builder of the property they are appraising, as this data may not yet be available through typical data sources (for example, public records or multiple listing services). In this scenario, it is acceptable for the appraiser to verify the transaction of the comparable sale by viewing a copy of the settlement statement from the builder’s ﬁle.
When providing builder sales from competing projects that are not presently available through traditional data sources, the appraiser must verify the sale from the applicable settlement statement and indicate on the appraisal report that the settlement statement was the document utilized for veriﬁcation. Additionally, the appraisal must include discussion and analysis of sales concessions and upgrades for the subject property relative to concessions and upgrades for each builder sale. (For special appraisal considerations regarding condo projects, see B4-1.4-03, Condo Appraisal Requirements.)
Rural Properties
Rural properties often have large lot sizes, and rural locations can be relatively undeveloped. Therefore, there may be a shortage (or absence) of recent truly comparable sales in the immediate vicinity of a subject property. If the appraiser's analysis of the market data shows the best indicators of value for the subject property are a considerable distance away, those comparable sales can be used if it produces credible assignment results. The appraisal must include an explanation of why the particular comparables were selected.
Use of Foreclosures and Short Sales
It is acceptable to use foreclosures and short sales as comparables if the market data indicates they are the
Published February 5, 2025
570
best and most appropriate sales available. The appraiser must address in the appraisal report the prevalence of such sales in the subject’s neighborhood and their impact. The appraiser must identify and consider any diﬀerences from the subject property, such as the condition of the property and whether any stigma has been associated with it. The appraiser cannot assume it is equal to the subject property. For example, a foreclosure or short sale property may be in worse condition when compared to the subject property, especially if the subject property is new construction or was recently renovated. For appraisals that are required to be UAD compliant, the appraiser must identify the ﬁnancing sale type as REO sale or Short sale, as appropriate. (For speciﬁc information regarding comparable sale adjustments, see B4-1.3-09, Adjustments to Comparable Sales, and for information regarding ﬁnancing types, see Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Uniform Appraisal Dataset Speciﬁcation, Appendix D: Field-Speciﬁc Standardization Requirements.

B4-1.3-09, Adjustments to Comparable Sales (12/11/2024)
Introduction This topic contains details on selected adjustments to the comparable sales, including:

Analysis of Adjustments
Fannie Mae does not have speciﬁc limitations or guidelines associated with net or gross adjustments. The

number and/or amount of the dollar adjustments must not be the sole determinant in the acceptability of a comparable. Ideally, the best and most appropriate comparable would require no adjustment; however, this is rarely the case as typically no two properties or transaction details are identical. The appraiser’s adjustments must reﬂect the market’s reaction (that is, market based adjustments) to the diﬀerence in the properties. For example, it would be inappropriate for an appraiser to provide a $20 per square foot adjustment for the diﬀerence in the gross living area based on a rule-of-thumb when market analysis indicates the adjustment should be $100 per square foot. The expectation is for the appraiser to analyze the market for competitive properties and provide appropriate market based adjustments without regard to arbitrary limits on the size of the adjustment.
If the extent of the appraiser’s adjustments to the comparable sales is great enough to indicate that the property may not conform to the neighborhood, the underwriter must determine if the opinion of value is adequately supported. (For further information regarding comparable selection, see B4-1.3-08, Comparable Sales.)
When there are no truly comparable sales for a particular property because of the uniqueness of the property or other conditions, the appraiser must select sales that represent the best indicators of value for the subject property and make market supported adjustments to reﬂect the actions of typical purchasers in that market.
Sales or Financing Concessions
Comparable sales that include sales or ﬁnancing concessions must be adjusted to reﬂect the impact, if any, on the sales price of the comparables based on the market at the time of sale. For information related to sales or ﬁnancing concessions for the subject transaction, see B3-4.1-02, Interested Party Contributions (IPCs).
Examples of sales or ﬁnancing concessions include:
interest rate buydowns or other below-market rate ﬁnancing;
loan discount points;
loan origination fees;
closing costs customarily paid by the buyer;
payment of condo, co-op, or PUD fees or assessment charges;
refunds of (or credit for) the borrower’s expenses;
absorption of monthly payments;
assignment of rent payments; and
inclusion of non-realty items in the transaction.
The dollar amount of sales or ﬁnancing concessions paid by the seller must be reported for the comparable sales if the information is reasonably available (see UAD Appendix D: Field–Speciﬁc Standardization Requirements, for data entry instructions). Sales or ﬁnancing data should be obtained from parties associated with the comparable transaction, such as the broker, buyer or seller, or a reliable data source. If information is not available because of legal restrictions or other disclosure-related problems, the appraiser must explain why the information is not available. If the appraisal report does not provide enough space to discuss this information, the appraiser must make an adjustment for the concessions on the form and include an explanation in an addendum to the appraisal report.
Published February 5, 2025
572
The amount of the negative dollar adjustment for each comparable with sales or ﬁnancing concessions should be equal to any increase in the purchase price of the comparable that the appraiser determines to be attributable to the concessions. The need to make negative dollar adjustments for sales or ﬁnancing concessions and the amount of the adjustments to the comparable sales is not based on how typical the concessions might be for a segment of the market area. Large sales or ﬁnancing concessions can be relatively typical in a particular segment of the market and still result in sale prices that reﬂect more than the value of the real estate. Adjustments based on dollar-for-dollar deductions that are equal to the cost of the concessions to the seller, as a strict cash equivalency approach would dictate, are not appropriate.
Fannie Mae recognizes that the eﬀect of sales or ﬁnancing concessions on sales prices can vary with the amount of the concessions and diﬀerences in various markets. Adjustments must reﬂect the diﬀerence between what the comparables actually sold for with the sales or ﬁnancing concessions and what they would have sold for without the concessions so that the dollar amount of the adjustments will approximate the reaction of the market to the concessions. If the appraiser’s analysis determines that the market’s reaction is the full amount of the ﬁnancing concession, a dollar-for-dollar adjustment is acceptable.
Positive adjustments for sales or ﬁnancing concessions are not acceptable. For example, if local common practice or law results in virtually all of the property sellers in the market area paying a 1% loan origination fee for the purchaser, and a property seller in that market did not pay any loan fees or concessions for the purchaser, the sale would be considered as a cash equivalent sale in that market. The appraiser must recognize comparable sales that sold for all cash or with cash equivalent ﬁnancing and use them as comparable sales if they are the best indicators of value for the subject property. Such sales also can be useful to the appraiser in determining those costs that are normally paid by sellers as the result of common practice or law in the market area.
Market Conditions Analysis and Time Adjustments
How to measure and analyze (market conditions) are critical elements in determining an accurate value because the appraisal is based on a speciﬁc date in time (eﬀective date of appraisal). The comparable sales being considered must be analyzed by the appraiser to determine if there have been any changes in market conditions from the time the comparable went under contract to the eﬀective date of the appraisal. This analysis will determine whether a time adjustment is warranted. A speciﬁc time adjustment to a comparable sale(s) may diﬀer from the identiﬁed market trend since the determination of whether an adjustment is made to a comparable sale is based on market changes between the contract date of the comparable sale and the eﬀective date of the appraisal. For example, the 12-month value trend may indicate a positive overall trend, however it's possible the market was stable (or declining) between the time period of the contract date of the comparable and the eﬀective date of the appraisal. See this illustration for Market Condition Adjustments. Comparable(s) sales with a contract date that is recent in relation to the eﬀective date of the appraisal will likely not have a time adjustment given the inability to identify a change in the market. The appraisal report must contain the market analysis that supports the indicated market trends, and any adjustments made for market conditions.
Because the appraisal is for a speciﬁc point in time (the eﬀective date of the appraisal), the appraiser must analyze comparable sales for any changes in market conditions from their contract dates through the eﬀective date to determine whether time adjustments are warranted. Time adjustments, or the lack thereof, must be supported by evidence. Use of home price indices (HPIs) to support time adjustments is consistent with our policy. The adjustment rates can also be determined through statistical analysis, modeling, paired sales, or other commonly accepted methods. The appraisal report must, at a minimum, summarize the supporting evidence and include a description of the data sources, tool(s), and technique(s) used.
Published February 5, 2025
573
Time adjustments should be supported by other comparables (such as sales, contracts) whenever possible; however, in all instances the appraiser must provide an explanation for the time adjustment in the appraisal report.
When completing Fannie Mae’s appraisal reports, the appraiser should provide the date of the sales contract and the settlement or closing date. Only the month and year need to be reported. For example, appraisers may use “s04/10” or “c02/10” where “s” reﬂects the settlement or closing date and “c” reﬂects the contract date. If the exact date is necessary to understand the adjustments, it must be explained elsewhere in the report or in an addendum. If the contract date is unavailable to the appraiser in the normal course of business, the appraiser must enter the abbreviation “Unk” for unknown, in place of the contract date.
Appraiser’s Comments and Indicated Value in the Sales Comparison Approach
The appraiser must provide fact-based and objective comment(s) that detail the work performed and data sources utilized for the market supported adjustments used, especially for the characteristics reported in the appraisal report form between the Sales or Financing Concessions and the Condition line items. A statement only recognizing that an adjustment has been made is not acceptable. When appropriate, the appraiser’s analysis should also include fact-based comments about a current contract, oﬀering, or listing for the subject or comparable sales, current ownership, and recent prior sales or transfers. Additionally, the appraiser’s comments must reﬂect his or her reconciliation of the adjusted (or indicated) values for the comparable sales and identify why the sale(s) were given the most weight in arriving at the indicated value for the subject property. It should be noted that the indicated value in the Sales Comparison Approach must be within the range of the adjusted sales price of the comparables that are reported in the appraisal.

B4-1.3-10, Cost and Income Approach to Value (09/04/2024)
Introduction This topic contains information on reviewing the cost approach and the income approach, including:
Published February 5, 2025
574
Cost Approach to Value Income Approach to Value
Cost Approach to Value
Fannie Mae does not require the cost approach to value except for the valuation of manufactured homes. However, USPAP requires the appraiser to develop and report the result of any approach to value that is necessary for credible assignment results. For example, when appraising proposed or newly constructed properties, if the appraiser believes the cost approach is necessary for credible assignment results, then the cost approach must be provided. Appraisals that rely solely on the cost approach as an indicator of market value are not acceptable.
The cost approach to value assumes that a potential purchaser will consider building a substitute residence that has the same use as the property being appraised. This approach, then, measures value as a cost of production. It may be appropriate to use the cost approach when appraising new or proposed construction, property that is undergoing renovation, unique property, or property that features functional depreciation, to support the sales comparison approach analysis. The reliability of the cost approach depends on valid reproduction cost estimates, proper depreciation estimates, and accurate site values.
If the appraiser has completed the cost approach, the lender must thoroughly review the information provided to conﬁrm that the appraiser’s analysis and comments for the cost approach to value are consistent with comments and adjustments mentioned elsewhere in the appraisal report. For example, if the neighborhood or site description reveals that the property backs up to a shopping center, lenders should expect to see an amount indicated for external depreciation in the cost approach. Or, if the improvement analysis indicates that it is necessary to go through one bedroom to get to another bedroom, lenders should expect to see an amount indicated for functional depreciation.
Income Approach to Value
The income approach to value is based on the assumption that market value is related to the market rent or income that a property can be expected to earn. The income approach to value is required in the valuation of two-unit to four-unit properties and may be appropriate in neighborhoods that consist of one-unit properties when there is a substantial rental market. The income approach to value may not be appropriate in areas that consist mostly of owner-occupied properties because adequate rental data does not exist for those areas. However, USPAP requires the appraiser to develop and report the result of any approach to value that is necessary for credible assignment results. If the appraiser believes the income approach is necessary for credible assignment results, then the income approach must be included. Appraisals that rely solely on the income approach as an indicator of market value are not acceptable.
When the income approach to value is used, the appraisal report must include the supporting comparable rental and sales data, and the calculations used to determine the gross rent multiplier. If the appraiser has completed the income approach, the lender must thoroughly review the information provided to conﬁrm that the appraiser’s analysis and comments for the income approach are consistent with comments mentioned elsewhere in the report.
The lender must validate these approaches to value in the appraisal report and comply with B4-1.1-04, Unacceptable Appraisal Practices.

Introduction This topic contains information on reviewing the valuation analysis and ﬁnal reconciliation, including:
Overview Reconciliation
Overview
The valuation sections of Fannie Mae’s appraisal report forms enable an appraiser to develop and report, in a concise format, an adequately supported opinion of market value based on the cost, sales comparison, and income approaches to value, as applicable. If the appraiser believes that additional information needs to be provided because of the uniqueness of the property or some other condition, they should provide additional supporting data in an addendum to the appraisal report form.
Reconciliation
In the Reconciliation section of the appraisal report form, the appraiser considers the reliability and applicability of each of the approaches to value that was utilized in the appraisal report. After consideration of each of the approaches to value, the appraiser will provide their ﬁnal value opinion. In the Reconciliation section, appraisers must
reconcile the reasonableness and reliability of each applicable approach to value,
reconcile the reasonableness and validity of the indicated values,
reconcile the reasonableness of available data, and
select and report the approach or approaches that were given the most weight.
The reconciliation is based on the appraiser’s analysis of the results developed as part of the valuation process and must never be an averaging technique with the exception of the use of a weighted average technique that

includes proper explanation. The ﬁnal reconciled indicated value must be within the range of the values indicated by the Approaches used in the appraisal report form.

Introduction This topic contains information on appraisal quality matters, including:
Changes to the Appraised Value Guidance on Addressing Appraisal Deﬁciencies Lender Requirements Fannie Mae’s Referrals to State Appraiser Boards Refusal to Accept Appraisals from Speciﬁc Appraisers
Changes to the Appraised Value
The lender is responsible for conﬁrming that appraisal reports are complete and that any changes to the reports are made by the appraiser that originally completed the report. If the lender has concerns with any aspect of the appraisal that result in questions about the reliability of the opinion of market value, the lender must attempt to resolve its concerns with the appraiser that originally prepared the report. If the lender is unable to resolve its concerns with the appraiser, the lender must obtain a replacement report prior to making a ﬁnal underwriting decision on the loan. Any request for a change in the opinion of market value must be based on material and substantive issues and must not be made solely on the basis that the opinion of market value as indicated in the appraisal report does not support the proposed loan amount. For information concerning the process lenders must follow to address a change of the opinion of market value, see Guidance on Addressing Appraisal Deﬁciencies in this topic.
Lenders must pay particular attention and institute extra due diligence for those loans in which the appraised value is believed to be excessive or when the value of the property has experienced signiﬁcant appreciation in a short time period since the prior sale. Fannie Mae believes that one of the best ways lenders can reduce the risk associated with excessive values or rapid appreciation is by receiving accurate appraisals from knowledgeable, experienced appraisers.
Published February 5, 2025
577
Guidance on Addressing Appraisal Deﬁciencies
If the lender considers an appraisal deﬁcient, it has the following options for addressing the deﬁciencies:
contacting the appraiser to address deﬁciencies contained in the appraisal report,
obtaining a desk review or a ﬁeld review of the original appraisal, or
obtaining a new appraisal of the subject property.
The lender can return the appraisal report to the appraiser that completed the assignment, identify the deﬁciencies found, and provide justiﬁcation for requesting correction of the deﬁciencies the lender believes make the report unreliable.
If the lender is unable to obtain a revised appraisal that adequately addresses its concerns, a desk or ﬁeld review of the report may be obtained. The review must be completed in accordance with the USPAP. Because the Scope of Work for either type of review allows for a change of the opinion of market value for something other than a mathematical error, the appraiser completing the appraisal review must
be licensed or certiﬁed in the state in which the property is located,
have access to the appropriate data sources, and
possess the knowledge and experience to appraise the subject property with respect to both the speciﬁc property type and geographical location.
The lender may forego either type of review and obtain a new appraisal. When a new appraisal is obtained, the lender must document the deﬁciencies that are the basis for ordering the new appraisal and adhere to a policy of selecting the most reliable appraisal, rather than the appraisal that states the highest value. The lender must either document the resolution of the noted deﬁciencies in the original appraisal or detail the reasons for relying on a second opinion of market value.
Lender Requirements
A lender must continually evaluate the quality of the appraiser’s work through the normal review process of all appraisal reports, as well as through the spot-check ﬁeld review or desk review of appraisals as part of its quality assurance system. For detailed requirements, see D1-3-04, Lender Post-Closing Quality Control Review of Appraisers, Appraisals, Property Data Collectors, and Property Data Collection.
Reconsideration of Value
For loans requiring an appraisal report, the lender must have policies and procedures in place for a borrower- initiated reconsideration of value (ROV). At a minimum, the ROV process must meet Fannie Mae requirements and adhere to all applicable local, state, and federal laws.
The ROV process must include a review and resolution procedure for the ROV request, and steps for the borrower(s) to appeal an appraisal when it is believed the opinion of value
is unsupported, may be deﬁcient due to unacceptable appraisal practices, or
Published February 5, 2025
578
reﬂects prohibited discriminatory practices.
Regardless of the outcome of the ROV, the lender is responsible for ensuring the appraisal report and opinion of market value are reliable and adequately supported.
The lender must provide a disclosure to the borrower outlining the ROV process at the time of loan application and again when the appraisal report is provided to the borrower. The disclosure must make it clear that only one borrower-initiated ROV is permitted per appraisal. The following table describes the information required to initiate the ROV process.
✓
The borrower-initiated ROV must include...
Borrower(s) name,
Property address,
Eﬀective date of the appraisal,
Appraiser name, and
Date of the ROV request.
Identiﬁcation and description of unsupported, inaccurate, or deﬁcient areas in the appraisal report.
Additional data, information, or comparable properties (not to exceed ﬁve), and the related data
sources (for example, the MLS listing number).
An explanation of why the new data supports the ROV.
In addition to the borrower ROV submission requirements, the lender's ROV policies and procedures must include instructions on required information for a borrower-submitted ROV and standardized communication to the appraiser. The following table describes additional lender requirements.
✓
The lender must...
complete its appraisal review before initiating the ROV process.
designate an underwriter or other appraisal subject matter expert to review the ROV request.
validate the request from the borrower contains suﬃcient details prior to sending to the appraiser.
obtain the necessary information from the borrower if the ROV request is unclear or needs more
information.
align its ROV policies and procedures with Appraiser Independence Requirements (AIR).
Published February 5, 2025
579
✓
The lender must...
standardize communication to the appraiser, that contains the following:
borrower(s) name, property address, eﬀective date of the appraisal, appraiser name, and date of
the ROV;
identiﬁcation and description of unsupported, inaccurate, or deﬁcient areas in the appraisal report;
additional data, information, or comparable properties, not to exceed the maximum of ﬁve;
a deﬁnition of turn-time expectations for communicating ROV results;
instructions for delivering the ROV response as part of a revised appraisal report that includes
commentary on conclusions regardless of the outcome; and
a reference for appraisers on how to correct minor appraisal issues or non-material errors not
related to the ROV process.
ensure all documentation and communications related to the initiation and outcome of the ROV are
retained in the loan ﬁle.
If material deﬁciencies identiﬁed in the appraisal report are not corrected or addressed by the appraiser upon request, or if there is evidence of any unacceptable appraisal practices detailed in B4-1.1-04, Unacceptable Appraisal Practices, the lender must forward the appraisal report and summary of ﬁndings to the appropriate appraisal licensing agency or regulatory board. The lender must also report suspected overt violations of anti- discrimination laws to the proper local, state, or federal agency. In the event of these occurrences, the lender may obtain a second or subsequent appraisal report.
Note: After a loan has closed, an ROV request is no longer allowed to be submitted by the borrower.
Fannie Mae’s Referrals to State Appraiser Boards
Fannie Mae conducts diﬀerent levels of due diligence for quality control purposes and may refer unacceptable appraisal reports to state appraiser licensing or regulatory boards for investigation.
Fannie Mae’s objectives in referring appraisal reports to state appraiser licensing or regulatory boards are
to emphasize continuing eﬀorts to maintain the quality of appraisals,
to protect Fannie Mae’s interest,
to improve the quality of mortgages delivered to Fannie Mae by identifying appraisers that have performed appraisals of a suﬃciently poor quality as to impair the security interests,
to help the industry enhance the quality of appraisals by identifying and referring appraisals that are not adequately supported or credible, and
to help enforce professional standards.
Note: Fannie Mae’s decision to make such referrals does not aﬀect the lender’s responsibility for managing the property valuation and appraisal review process.
Published February 5, 2025
580
Refusal to Accept Appraisals from Speciﬁc Appraisers
Fannie Mae may refuse to accept appraisals prepared by speciﬁc appraisers, or Fannie Mae may notify a lender that appraisals prepared by a given appraiser are no longer accepted. When a lender is notiﬁed that appraisals from speciﬁc appraisers are no longer accepted, the lender is prohibited from delivering mortgages to Fannie Mae secured by properties appraised by that individual immediately following its receipt of Fannie Mae’s notice.

Overview
Fannie Mae requires market-based property valuations for manufactured homes demonstrated by a well- developed sales comparison approach to value that is further supported by the cost approach to value.
For manufactured housing property eligibility requirements, including special appraisal requirements for MH Advantage properties, see B2-3-02, Special Property Eligibility and Underwriting Considerations: Factory-Built Housing. For manufactured housing mortgage eligibility and underwriting requirements, see B5-2, Manufactured Housing.
Manufactured Housing Appraiser Qualiﬁcations
The valuation principles for appraising manufactured homes are essentially the same as for other types of residential property. However, not all appraisers are knowledgeable and experienced about the unique construction process, as well as the manufacturers’ and federal, state, and local requirements for both construction and installation.
The lender must ensure that the appraiser is knowledgeable about the local manufactured home market and the unique construction process for manufactured homes, and has access to appropriate data sources in order to render an opinion of value for the manufactured home. Lenders must establish policies and procedures to ensure that qualiﬁed individuals are being selected in accordance with Fannie Mae requirements as well as the Appraiser Independence Requirements.
Manufactured Housing Appraisal Requirements and Standards
The list below provides requirements and standards for manufactured housing appraisals.
For purchase money mortgages, the lender must provide the appraiser with
a complete copy of the executed contract for sale of the manufactured home and land; or
a complete copy of the executed contract for both, if the manufactured home and land are purchased separately; and
a copy of the manufacturer’s invoice if the manufactured home is new.
The appraiser must analyze the contract(s) and the manufacturer’s invoice for new manufactured homes, and provide a summary in the appraisal report.
The appraiser must report the results of a manufactured home appraisal on the Manufactured Home Appraisal Report (Form 1004C). The use of Form 1004C will help to ensure that the appraiser inspected, considered, and reported the appropriate information including, but not limited to, the:
manufacturer’s name,
trade or model number,
year of manufacture,
serial number,
Published February 5, 2025
582
Certiﬁcation number(s) from the HUD Data Plate or HUD Certiﬁcation Label(s),
type of foundation and utility connections,
detailed and supported cost approach,
opinion of the market value of the site, and
property’s conformity to the neighborhood.
Note: For existing construction, the appraiser must also provide a photo(s) of the HUD Data Plate or the HUD Certiﬁcation Label(s) for each section of the home. (Both are required for new construction.)
The appraiser must indicate a value conclusion based solely on the real property as completed consisting of the
manufactured home,
site improvements, and
land on which the home is situated.
The value conclusion cannot include any non-realty items including, but not limited to, insurance, warranties, and furniture.
Newly Constructed Manufactured Housing Appraisal Requirements
For new manufactured homes not yet attached to the land or not yet constructed, the appraisal may be based on either plans and speciﬁcations or an existing model home. If required information is not available at the time the appraiser is completing the appraisal forms, the appraiser must appraise the property subject to the receipt and review of the items and completion of the improvements as a condition of the appraisal. Information that may not be available can include, but is not limited to, the dealer invoice, the HUD Data Plate, and the Certiﬁcation Label numbers.
A certiﬁcation of completion must be obtained before the mortgage is sold to Fannie Mae. The certiﬁcation must
be completed by the original appraiser if possible, or if not possible, by a substitute appraiser as provided for in B4-1.2-04, Appraisal Age and Use Requirements;
verify and state that the improvements were completed and all other requirements and conditions of the appraisal have been satisﬁed;
include previously unavailable information, and a summary of the appraiser’s analysis of any previously unavailable dealer invoice; and
include photos of the completed improvements attached to the permanent foundation, and of the HUD Data Plate and HUD Certiﬁcation Label(s), or acceptable alternatives.
Manufactured Housing Appraisal Site Requirements
The appraisal site requirements for manufactured housing are as follows:
The appraiser must base their opinion of value on the characteristics of the subject property, including
Published February 5, 2025
583
the site area. The appraisal report must indicate whether or not the site is compatible with the neighborhood, and must comment on the conformity of the manufactured home to other manufactured homes in the neighborhood.
The property site must be of a size, shape, and topography that is conforming and acceptable in the neighborhood. It must also have competitive utilities, street improvements, adequate vehicular access, and other amenities. Because amenities, easements, and encroachments may either detract from or enhance the marketability of a site, the appraiser must reﬂect them in their analysis and valuation. The appraiser must comment if the site has adverse conditions or is not typical for the neighborhood.
Manufactured Housing Appraisal Comparable Selection Requirements Excluding MH Advantage
The comparable selection requirements for manufactured housing appraisals, excluding MH Advantage are as follows:
The appraiser must use a minimum of two comparable sales that are manufactured homes. If the subject property is a single-width manufactured home, one comparable must be a closed sale of the same single- width conﬁguration, when available. If the appraiser is unable to ﬁnd a single-width comparable sale, an active listing or “under contract” sale will qualify as a supplemental exhibit to show marketability. The appraiser may use either site-built housing or a diﬀerent type of factory-built housing as the third comparable sale. The appraiser must explain why site-built housing or a diﬀerent type of factory-built housing is being used for the third comparable sale, and make and support appropriate adjustments in the appraisal report.
In markets where condo projects with manufactured homes are more common, at least two comparables should be manufactured homes located in a condominium project. In markets where condo projects with manufactured homes are atypical, the appraiser may select comparables from a mixture of manufactured homes and manufactured home condos provided the appraiser is able to provide adequate written explanation and make appropriate adjustments.
An appraiser that is unable to locate sales of manufactured homes that are truly comparable to the subject property may decide it is appropriate to use either older sales of similar manufactured homes or sales of similar manufactured homes that are located in a competing neighborhood to establish a baseline for the “sales comparison analysis” and determine sound adjustments to reﬂect the diﬀerences between comparable sales that are available and the subject property.
The appraiser must not create comparable sales by combining vacant land sales with the contract purchase price of the home. This type of information may be used as additional supporting documentation.
MH Advantage Appraisal Comparable Selection Requirements
MH Advantage properties are built to meet construction, architectural design, and energy eﬃciency standards that are more consistent with site-built homes. Accordingly, for MH Advantage properties, appraisers must use other MH Advantage properties (homes that have an MH Advantage sticker) for the comparable sales. However, if fewer than three MH Advantage sales are available, then the appraiser must supplement those comparable sales with the best and most appropriate sales available. Such sales must include a minimum of two site-built homes in recognition of the design standards for MH Advantage. There is no requirement to include factory-built
Published February 5, 2025
584
home sales that are not MH Advantage, but if used, the appraiser must note why it was selected as a comparable sale, based on an assessment of the physical features of the subject property.
Manufactured Housing Appraisal Cost Approach Requirements
Fannie Mae requires a detailed and supported cost approach to value for all manufactured homes which must, at a minimum, contain the information indicated on the Form 1004C. The appraiser may choose to report the results of the cost approach on Form 1004C or by using a report form from a published cost service as an addendum to the appraisal report form. Whatever format the appraiser chooses to report the cost approach, the information must be suﬃcient to allow the lender to replicate the cost ﬁgures and calculations. The sales comparison and cost approach to value are complementary for the valuation of manufactured housing and must support the ﬁnal value conclusion. A properly developed and detailed cost approach will provide the information necessary for an appraiser to
recognize diﬀerences in manufactured home construction quality,
understand the diﬀerence between the comparable sales and the subject property,
extract from the market appropriate adjustments for the sales comparison analysis, and
identify sales of manufactured homes that are similar enough to the subject property to use as comparable sales.
Sources of Manufactured Housing Data
Traditional appraisal data sources do not provide enough quality manufactured home data for the appraiser to develop a supportable and well-documented manufactured home appraisal. While sources such as MLS and public records are important and may contain some data, appraisers must utilize other data sources, such as manufactured home dealers and construction companies/builders experienced in the installation of manufactured homes.
One important source of manufactured housing information is the NADA Manufactured Housing Appraisal Guide. That publication
lists general manufactured home depreciated replacement values based on original factory construction categories, and
oﬀers a step-by-step process for arriving at the average retail book value for a manufactured home and can be used to develop a cost approach.
Note: NADA chart values assume the home is in average condition. The publication provides deﬁnitions for “excellent,” “good,” “average,” “fair,” and “poor” to appropriately identify the condition of the manufactured home.
Another source of information is Marshall & Swift’s Residential Cost Handbook. Marshall & Swift provides
information that enables the user to arrive at an estimate of the cost of the manufactured home when new and the replacement cost based on, among other things, the construction quality; as well as
an explanation of the items that enables the appraiser to support their conclusion of the overall
Published February 5, 2025
585
construction quality of the manufactured home.
The appraiser must support their opinion about both the quality and the condition of the manufactured home because they play a very important role in the value and marketability of manufactured homes. The NADA guide or the Marshall & Swift handbook may be used as additional sources to provide support for the appraiser’s conclusions about the quality and value of a manufactured home.

B4-1.4-02, Factory-Built Housing: Modular, Prefabricated, Panelized,
or Sectional Housing (10/06/2021)
Introduction This topic contains information on special appraisal considerations for modular, prefabricated, panelized, or sectional housing, including:
Overview Appraisal Requirements for Modular, Prefabricated, Panelized, or Sectional Housing Comparable Selection Requirements for Modular, Prefabricated, Panelized, or Sectional Housing
Overview
Modular homes must be built under the International Residential Code (IRC) that is administered by the state agency that is responsible for adopting and administering building code requirements for the state in which the modular home is installed. Prefabricated, panelized, or sectional housing does not have to satisfy either HUD’s Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards or the IRC that are adopted and administered by the state in which the home is installed. The home must conform to local building codes in the area in which it will be installed.

For modular, prefabricated, panelized, or sectional housing eligibility requirements, see B2-3-02, Special Property Eligibility and Underwriting Considerations: Factory-Built Housing.
Appraisal Requirements for Modular, Prefabricated, Panelized, or Sectional Housing
Fannie Mae does not have minimum requirements for width, size, roof pitch, or any other speciﬁc construction detail for modular homes, or any other types of factory-built homes. Because quality can account for large diﬀerences in the values of factory-built homes, it is important for the appraiser to become familiar with the features that aﬀect the quality of a factory-built home so that the information can be included in the appraisal report if needed to support their opinion of value.
Comparable Selection Requirements for Modular, Prefabricated, Panelized, or Sectional Housing
The process of selecting comparable sales for factory-built housing is generally the same as that for selecting comparable sales for site-built housing. Fannie Mae requires the appraiser to address both the marketability and comparability of modular homes and other types of factory-built housing. When the subject property is modular, prefabricated, panelized, or sectional housing, it is not required that one or more of the comparable sales be the same type of factory-built housing, although using comparable sales of similar types of homes generally enhances the reliability of the appraiser's opinion of value. Fannie Mae requires the appraiser to include in the appraisal report the most appropriate comparable sales data to support their opinion of value for the subject property. See B4-1.3-08, Comparable Sales, for general requirements regarding comparable selection.

Overview Appraisal Requirements for Units in a Condo Project
Published February 5, 2025
587
Overview
A condo project is one in which individual owners hold title to units in the project along with an undivided interest in the real estate that is designated as the common area for the project.
Appraisal Requirements for Units in a Condo Project
The appraisal of an individual unit in a condo project requires the appraiser to analyze the condo project as well as the individual unit. The value and marketability of the individual units in a project depend on the marketability and appeal of the project itself. Therefore, the appraiser must pay special attention to
the location of the individual unit within the project,
the project amenities, and
the amount and purpose of the owner’s association assessment.
See B4-1.3-08, Comparable Sales, for general requirements regarding comparable selection.

B4-1.4-04, Co-op Appraisal Requirements (04/15/2014)

Overview Appraisal Requirements for Co-op Share Loans Comparable Selection Requirements for Co-op Share Loans Comparable Selection Requirements for Co-op Share Loans in Established Projects Comparable Selection Requirements for Co-op Share Loans in New (or Recently Converted) Projects
Overview
A co-op corporation holds title to a co-op project and grants occupancy rights to particular apartments or units to shareholders through proprietary leases or similar arrangements. The co-op interest is the co-op shares or other evidence of an ownership interest in the co-op corporation and the accompanying occupancy rights, excluding the co-op interest’s pro rata share of the debt service of the blanket mortgage. In other words, the co- op interest is the equity portion that is over and above the pro rata share of the blanket mortgage(s).
Published February 5, 2025
588
Note: The lender is required to receive Fannie Mae approval to deliver mortgages secured by units in co-op projects.
Appraisal Requirements for Co-op Share Loans
The appraisal requirements for co-op share loans are as follows:
Appraisers must develop an opinion of the market value of the co-op interest when evaluating co-op units. To determine the value of the co-op interest, appraisers must consider and report, among other things, the following information:
the number of shares attributable to the unit;
the number of shares issued and outstanding for the co-op corporation;
the name of the lienholder, the lien position, and the amount and repayment terms of all project blanket ﬁnancing;
the pro rata share of the blanket mortgage payments that are attributable to the unit, as determined by dividing the number of shares attributable to the unit by the total number of project shares;
the pro rata share of each lien that is attributable to the unit;
any tax abatements or exemptions that are attributable to the unit;
the remaining term for any tax abatements or exemptions and provisions for escalation of real estate taxes, which is the dollar amount by which the taxes will increase and the year in which the increase will occur; and
any monthly maintenance fees, including:
utility charges, if they are part of these fees;
monthly special assessments;
ground rent;
other fees for the use of the facilities that are attributable to the unit; and
the fee type, amount, and term (if applicable) of those other fees.
This information can be developed through Request for Cooperative Project Information (Form 1074), if the management agent, co-op board, or project sponsor/developer uses the form to respond to lender or appraiser inquiries for project information. When Form 1074 is used, appraisers may either transcribe the appropriate information to the applicable appraisal report or attach the form to the report as an addendum.
Appraisers must use reliable sources to obtain data on the co-op project, the individual subject unit, and the comparable properties, and indicate the name of each source on the appraisal report or in an addendum to the appraisal report.
Appraisers must address any factors that could result in an increase to the monthly debt service for the subject unit.
Appraisers must indicate in the Sales Comparison Approach adjustment grid the dollar amount of the monthly assessments for each of the comparable sales.
Published February 5, 2025
589
Appraisers must report the value of the co-op interest, excluding its pro rata share of the blanket mortgage(s). This value reﬂects the market value for the co-op interest of the unit. For example, when the indicated value of the unit encumbered by the blanket mortgage(s) is $100,000, and it’s pro rata share of the blanket mortgage(s) is $25,000, the value estimate that the appraiser must report for the co- op interest of the unit is $75,000.
Appraisers must include a certiﬁcation in the appraisal report that the pro rata share of the blanket mortgage(s) on the real estate has not been included in the opinion of the market value of the co-op interest.
Comparable Selection Requirements for Co-op Share Loans
The comparable selection requirements for co-op share loans are as follows:
Appraisers must comment on the acceptance of housing co-ops in the market area. The degree of acceptance is generally reﬂected in the availability of similar comparable sales data for co-op units. If there is limited market acceptance of the co-op form of ownership or if co-op forms of ownership are relatively new in the market area, appraisers must address any eﬀect that has on the value and marketability of the unit that is being appraised. The appraiser must compare the subject unit to the general market area as well as to other units in the subject co-op project. This comparison demonstrates market acceptance of co-op units in the area.
Comparable sales must be from similar types of projects that have similar common amenities and recreational facilities including, but not limited to, townhouses and mid-rise and high-rise buildings.
When available, appraisers must use sales from co-op units as comparables. However, appraisers may use condo units as comparable sales if co-op units are not available, as long as the appraiser explains why those types of comparables were used and adjusts the condo comparables to reﬂect the reaction of the market to the co-op unit when there is a preference for condo ownership in the subject market area.
See B4-1.3-08, Comparable Sales, for general requirements regarding comparable selection.
Comparable Selection Requirements for Co-op Share Loans in Established Projects
Comparable sales from within the same project as the subject property should be used if the project has resale activity. Sales activity from within the project should be the best indicator of value for properties in that project.
Note: Use of comparable sales located outside of the established subject neighborhood must be explained in the appraisal analysis.
When the subject property is a unit in an established co-op project that has sales activity, appraisers should use the following as comparables:
two closed or settled sales from within the subject project, if available; and
one closed or settled sale from a competing project.
See B4-1.3-08, Comparable Sales, for general requirements regarding comparable selection.
Published February 5, 2025

Comparable Selection Requirements for Co-op Share Loans in New (or Recently Converted) Projects
If the subject property is a unit in a new or recently converted co-op project, appraisers should select as comparables
one closed or settled sale from the subject project, if one is available; and
two closed or settled sales from outside of the project.
If closed or settled sales are not available in the subject project, appraisers must use sales from competing projects.
See B4-1.3-08, Comparable Sales, for general requirements regarding comparable selection.

B4-1.4-05, Leasehold Interests Appraisal Requirements (11/06/2024)
Introduction This topic contains information on special appraisal considerations for properties subject to leasehold interests, including:
Overview Appraisal Requirements for Leasehold Interests Comparable Selection Requirements for Leasehold Interests
Overview
A mortgage that is secured by a leasehold estate or is subject to the payment of “ground rent” gives the borrower the right to use and occupy the real property under the provisions of a lease agreement or ground lease, for a stipulated period of time, as long as the conditions of the lease are met. When the lease holder is a community land trust, there may be signiﬁcant restrictions on both the purchase and resale of the property. For more information on appraising this type of leasehold, see B4-1.4-06, Community Land Trust Appraisal Requirements.
Appraisal Requirements for Leasehold Interests
The appraisal requirements for leasehold interest properties are as follows:

Appraisers must develop a thorough, clear, and detailed narrative that identiﬁes the terms, restrictions, and conditions regarding lease agreements or ground leases and include this information as an addendum to the appraisal report.
Appraisers must discuss what eﬀect, if any, the terms, restrictions, and conditions of the lease agreement or ground lease have on the value and marketability of the subject property.
Comparable Selection Requirements for Leasehold Interests
When there are a suﬃcient number of closed comparable property sales with similar leasehold interests available, the appraiser must use the property sales in the analysis of market value of the leasehold estate for the subject property.
However, if not enough comparable sales with the same lease terms and restrictions are available, appraisers may use sales of similar properties with diﬀerent lease terms or, if necessary, sales of similar properties that were sold as fee simple estates. The appraiser must explain why the use of these sales is appropriate, and must make appropriate adjustments in the Sales Comparison Approach adjustment grid to reﬂect the market reaction to the diﬀerent lease terms or property rights appraised. See B4-1.3-08, Comparable Sales, for general requirements regarding comparable selection.

Appraiser Qualiﬁcations for Appraising Properties Located in a Community Land Trust Appraisal Requirements for Community Land Trust Appraisals Comparable Selection Requirements for Determining Fee Simple Value Determining the Capitalization Rate Determining the Leasehold Value Addendum to the Appraisal Report
Published February 5, 2025

Appraiser Qualiﬁcations for Appraising Properties Located in a Community Land Trust
The lender must ensure that the appraiser is knowledgeable and experienced in the appraisal techniques, namely the direct capitalization and the market derivation of capitalization rates that are necessary to appraise a property subject to a leasehold estate held by a community land trust. Lenders must establish policies and procedures to ensure that qualiﬁed individuals are being selected in accordance with Fannie Mae requirements including the Appraiser Independence Requirements.
Appraisal Requirements for Community Land Trust Appraisals
The appraisal requirements for community land trust properties are as follows:
The appraiser must analyze the property subject to the ground lease when a leasehold interest is held by a community land trust. Because the community land trust typically subsidizes the sales price to the borrower, that price may be signiﬁcantly less than the market value of the leasehold interest in the property.
The appraised value of the leasehold interest in the property must be well supported and correctly developed by the appraiser because the resale restrictions, as well as other restrictions that may be included in the ground lease, can also aﬀect the value of the property. Fannie Mae requires the Community Land Trust Ground Lease Rider, that the lender and the borrower must execute, to remove such restrictions from the community land trust’s ground lease. The land records for the subject property must include adoption of the terms and conditions that are incorporated in that ground lease rider. The appraiser must develop the opinion of value for the leasehold interest under the hypothetical condition that the property rights being appraised are the leasehold interest without the resale and other restrictions that the ground lease rider removes when Fannie Mae has to dispose of a property acquired through foreclosure. (For additional information, see Section B5-5.3, Shared Equity Transactions, for legal considerations.)
The appraiser must use a three-step process to develop an opinion of value.
Step
The appraiser must determine
1
the fee simple value of the property by using the sales comparison analysis approach to value,
2
the applicable capitalization rate and convert the income from the ground lease into a leased fee
value by using the market-derived capitalization rate, and
3
the leasehold value by reducing the fee simple value by the lease fee value. (For detailed
information related to this process, see below.)
Note: When this appraisal technique is used, there is no need to document the actual land value of
Published February 5, 2025
593
the security property.
On the actual appraisal report form, the appraiser must
indicate “leasehold” as the property rights appraised,
provide the applicable ground rent paid to the community land trust,
show the estimated fee simple value for the property in the Sales Comparison Approach adjustment grid,
report the “leasehold value” as the indicated value conclusion, and
check the box “as is” and include in the addendum the development of the capitalization rate and an expanded discussion of the comparable sales used and considered.
Comparable Selection Requirements for Determining Fee Simple Value
In determining the fee simple value of the subject property, the appraiser must use comparable sales of similar properties that are owned as fee simple estates. If this is not possible, the appraiser may use sales of properties that are subject to other types of leasehold estates as long as they make appropriate adjustments, based on the terms of their leases, to reﬂect a fee simple interest.
When the community or neighborhood has sales activity for other leasehold estates held by a community land trust, the appraiser must discuss them in the appraisal report, but must not use them as comparable sales because, in all likelihood, the sales prices will have been limited by restrictions in the ground lease. Therefore, these sales transactions would not be comparable to the hypothetical condition that the property rights being appraised are the leasehold interest without the resale and other restrictions on which Fannie Mae requires the appraisal of the subject property to be based. See B4-1.3-08, Comparable Sales, for general requirements regarding comparable selection.
Determining the Capitalization Rate
When the community has an active real estate market that includes sales of properties owned as fee simple estates and sales of properties subject to leasehold estates other than those held by community land trusts, the appraiser can use the most direct method for determining the capitalization rate, extracting it from the market activity. To extract the capitalization rate, the appraiser must divide the annual ground rent for the properties subject to leasehold estates by the diﬀerence in the sales prices for the comparable sales of properties owned as fee simple estates and the comparable sales of properties subject to leasehold estates.
If there are no available comparable sales of properties subject to leasehold estates other than those held by a community land trust, the appraiser must develop a capitalization rate by comparing alternative low-risk investment rates, such as the rates for long-term bonds, and selecting a rate that best reﬂects a “riskless” (safe) rate.
Determining the Leasehold Value
To determine the leasehold value of the subject property, the appraiser must ﬁrst convert the annual income from the community land trust’s ground lease into a leased fee value by dividing the income by the market-
Published February 5, 2025
594
derived capitalization rate. The appraiser must then reduce the estimated fee simple value of the subject property by this leased fee value to arrive at their opinion of the leasehold value of the subject property.
For example, assume that the annual ground rent from the community land trust’s ground lease is $300, the market-derived capitalization rate is 5.75%, and the estimated fee simple value of the subject property is $100,000:
$300 annual rent/5.75% capitalization rate = $5,217.39 (rounded to $5,200)
$100,000 fee simple value – $5,200 leased fee value = $94,800 (leasehold value)
Addendum to the Appraisal Report
Because Fannie Mae’s appraisal report forms do not include space to provide all of the details required for appraising a property subject to a leasehold held by a community land trust, the appraiser must attach an addendum to the appraisal report to provide any information that cannot otherwise be presented on the appraisal report form. As previously mentioned, the appraiser must check the box “as is” and include in the addendum the development of the capitalization rate and an expanded discussion of the comparable sales used and considered. The addendum must also include the following statement:
“This appraisal is made on the basis of the hypothetical condition that the property rights being appraised are the leasehold interest without resale and other restrictions that are removed by the Community Land Trust Ground Lease Rider.”

B4-1.4-08, Environmental Hazards Appraisal Requirements
(03/01/2023)
Introduction This topic contains information on special appraisal considerations for properties aﬀected by environmental hazards, including:
Overview Appraisal Requirements Lender Requirements
Overview
Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes mortgage loans secured by properties aﬀected by environmental hazards if the eﬀect of the hazard is measurable through an analysis of comparable market data as of the eﬀective date of the appraisal, and the appraiser reﬂects in the appraisal report any adverse eﬀect that the hazard has on the value and marketability of the subject property or indicates that the comparable market data reveals no buyer resistance to the hazard.
In rare situations, a particular environmental hazard may have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the value of the subject
Published February 5, 2025
596
property, although the actual eﬀect is not measurable because the hazard is so serious or so recently discovered that an appraiser cannot arrive at a reliable opinion of market value because there is no comparable market data available, such as sales, contract sales, or active listings that are available to reﬂect the eﬀect of the hazard. In such cases, the mortgage will not be eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae.
Appraisal Requirements
When the appraiser has knowledge of any hazardous condition, whether it exists in or on the subject property or on any site within the vicinity of the property, including but not limited to, the presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, asbestos-containing materials, urea-formaldehyde insulation, or radon gas, the appraiser must
note the hazardous condition in the appraisal report;
comment on any inﬂuence the hazard has on the property’s value and marketability, if it is measurable through an analysis of comparable market data as of the eﬀective date of the appraisal, or indicate that the comparable market data reveals no buyer resistance to the hazard;
make appropriate adjustments in the overall analysis of the property’s value; and
make the appraisal "subject to" inspection by a qualiﬁed professional.
Fannie Mae expects the appraiser to consider and use comparable market data from the same aﬀected area because the sales prices of settled sales, the contract sales prices of pending sales, and the current asking prices for active listings will reﬂect any negative eﬀect on value and marketability of the subject property.
Note: Fannie Mae does not consider the appraiser to be an expert in the ﬁeld of environmental hazards. The typical residential real estate appraiser is neither expected nor required to be an expert in this specialized ﬁeld. The appraiser, however, has a responsibility to note in the appraisal report any adverse conditions that were observed during the inspection of the subject property or information that they became aware of through the normal research involved in performing an appraisal.
Lender Requirements
Fannie Mae requires the lender to disclose any information regarding environmental hazards to the appraiser and note the individual mortgage ﬁle accordingly if the real estate agent, the property seller, the property purchaser, or any other party to the mortgage transaction informs the lender that an environmental hazard exists in or on the property, or in the vicinity of the property. Fannie Mae also requires the lender to disclose such information to the borrower, and to comply with any state or local environmental laws regarding disclosure.
The lender must make the ﬁnal decision about the need for inspections and the adequacy of the property as security for the mortgage. For example, because Fannie Mae requires the appraiser to comment on the eﬀect of a hazard on the value and marketability of the subject property, the appraiser would have to note when there is market resistance to an area because of environmental hazards or any other conditions that aﬀect well, septic, or public water facilities. When the lender has reason to believe that private well water that is on or available to a property might be contaminated as a result of the proximity of the well to hazardous waste sites, the lender is exercising sound judgment if it obtains a “well certiﬁcation” to determine whether the water meets community standards.

Appraisal Requirements (04/15/2014)
Introduction This topic contains information on special appraisal considerations for properties in special assessment or community facilities districts, including:
Overview Lender Responsibilities Related to Special Assessment or Community Facilities Districts Special Assessment Districts Appraisal Requirements for Properties Located in Special Assessment Districts Community Facilities Districts Appraisal Requirements for Properties Located in Community Facilities Districts
Overview
Alternative methods for raising the capital necessary to satisfy utility and infrastructure requirements are sometimes used in the development of new residential communities. In some instances, this involves the creation of local districts called special assessment districts or community facilities districts that have the authority to assess homeowners for the cost of developing utility services and various infrastructure facilities, including, but not limited to, roads, sewer services, schools, police and ﬁre protection services, and libraries.
Lender Responsibilities Related to Special Assessment or Community Facilities Districts
Fannie Mae expects the lender to know if a property is located in one of these districts and to be aware of the eﬀect that assessments levied by the district could have on property values and the marketability of the subject property. The lender’s appraiser, therefore, must give special consideration to the valuation of properties located in these districts.
Special Assessment Districts
Published February 5, 2025
598
Special assessment districts, also called special tax districts or municipal utility districts, provide a speciﬁc service to homeowners living in a designated area. They are most often established to provide water or other utilities in areas that are not served by existing city or municipal utility services. The need for these districts arises when an existing utility service does not have suﬃcient capacity, or may not ﬁnd it economically feasible to provide services for newly created subdivisions that are located beyond its current operating area. State law governing the establishment of special assessment districts varies greatly, as does the ﬁnancial strength of the individual districts. These districts are granted the authority to assess owners of properties within their boundaries for funds that will be used to cover their operating costs and debt service.
Special assessment districts that are established to serve newly developing subdivisions with utilities often base their ﬁnancial plans and the amount of the assessment to be charged to each property owner on the expected number of properties in the area to be served. The district then depends on the continuation of development to maintain its budget expectations. If, for any reason, development stops short of the degree of development that the district anticipated in preparing its budget, the district can become ﬁnancially distressed and may need to impose an additional assessment on the existing homeowners.
Appraisal Requirements for Properties Located in Special Assessment Districts
The appraisal requirements for properties located in special assessment districts must
report any special assessments that aﬀect the property, and
note in the appraisal report if the special assessment district is experiencing ﬁnancial diﬃculty and that the diﬃculty has an eﬀect on the value or marketability of the subject property.
To ensure that the reaction of the market to the potential liabilities that may arise within a ﬁnancially troubled special assessment district is reﬂected in their analysis, the appraiser must consider current and expired listings or properties for sale within the district and any pending contract sales and recent closed sales within the district.
There may be some instances in which the ﬁnancial diﬃculty of a special assessment district is so severe that its actual eﬀect on the value and marketability of a property is not measurable because there is no comparable market data available to enable the appraiser to arrive at a reliable opinion of market value. When this is the case, a mortgage secured by a property in that district will not be eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae until such time that an active market develops that will enable the appraiser to demonstrate the value and marketability of the subject property.
Community Facilities Districts
Some jurisdictions have passed legislation that creates community facilities districts and permits them to levy a special tax to fund the capital costs of a wide variety of public improvements, as well as the ongoing operation and maintenance costs of a limited number of public services. Proceeds from the special tax are used to support the sale of tax-exempt bonds for the various capital improvements that are allowed under the legislation, including but not limited to, roads, sewer services, schools, police and ﬁre protection services, and libraries.
The assessment that will be used to repay the tax-exempt bonds becomes an ongoing responsibility of the property owner, similar to state and local property taxes. The assessment lien and the obligation to pay the assessment passes with the title to the property when ownership of the property is transferred.
Published February 5, 2025
599
Such legislation generally requires full disclosure of the special assessment to any purchaser of a property located in a community facilities district. Therefore, a lender originating mortgages in community facilities districts should disclose to the appraiser any information that it becomes aware of regarding special assessments on a given property.
Appraisal Requirements for Properties Located in Community Facilities Districts
Appraisers must be aware of whether the subject property and the comparables are located within or aﬀected by a community facilities district because properties subject to an assessment by one of these districts often compete against properties that are either subject to a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent assessment or no assessment at all. Appraisers must consider the reaction of the market, if any, to the assessment for the applicable community facilities district by analyzing similarly aﬀected comparable sales in their analysis, and should note the eﬀect of the assessment in the appraisal report.

B4-1.4-10, Value Acceptance (Appraisal Waiver) (03/01/2023)
Introduction This topic contains information about value acceptance (appraisal waiver), including:
Overview Prior Appraisal Requirements Eligible Transactions Ineligible Transactions Representations and Warranties Rural High-Needs Value Acceptance (Appraisal Waiver) Exercising a Value Acceptance (Appraisal Waiver)
Overview
For certain loan caseﬁles, DU oﬀers value acceptance (appraisal waiver), in which case an appraisal is not required. For loan caseﬁles that are not eligible for value acceptance (appraisal waiver), DU will require an appraisal reported on the appropriate appraisal report form for the type of property being appraised.
Prior Appraisal Requirements
For value acceptance (appraisal waiver) to be considered, generally a prior appraisal must be found for the subject property in Fannie Mae’s Collateral Underwriter (CU) data. When required, DU will compare the address
Published February 5, 2025
600
for the subject property to the property addresses found in CU. DU will use the information from the prior appraisal to determine if the loan caseﬁle is eligible for the appraisal waiver. In some cases, the prior appraisal may not be acceptable. For example, if a CU “Overvaluation Flag” was issued on the prior appraisal, or the appraisal could not be scored, that prior appraisal will not be used and an appraisal waiver will not be oﬀered on the new loan caseﬁle.
Eligible Transactions
A value acceptance (appraisal waiver) oﬀer will be considered for the following transactions:
one-unit properties, including condos;
principal residence and second home transactions;
investment property reﬁnance transactions;
certain purchase, limited cash-out, and cash-out reﬁnance transactions; and
DU loan caseﬁles that receive an Approve/Eligible recommendation.
Ineligible Transactions
The following transactions are not eligible for a value acceptance (appraisal waiver) oﬀer:
two- to four-unit properties;
co-op units and manufactured homes;
proposed construction;
construction-to-permanent loans (single-close and two-close);
HomeStyle Renovation and HomeStyle Energy loans;
leasehold properties;
Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans;
community land trusts or other properties with resale price restrictions, which include loan caseﬁles using the Aﬀordable LTV feature;
transactions where either the purchase price or estimated value provided to DU is $1,000,000 or more;
transactions using gifts of equity;
DU loan caseﬁles that receive an Ineligible recommendation; and
manually underwritten loans.
Note: DU may oﬀer value acceptance (appraisal waiver) on a recently constructed property (i.e., new construction) when there is an existing “as is” prior appraisal for the subject property. For example, an appraisal of the subject property may have been performed for a diﬀerent lender or borrower, but that loan did not close. The lender may execute the value acceptance (appraisal waiver) oﬀer when the loan meets all other eligibility criteria for the transaction.
Published February 5, 2025
601
Furthermore, the lender may not exercise a value acceptance (appraisal waiver) oﬀer and must order an appraisal if one or more of the following applies:
DU was unable to identify ineligible criteria in the list above (for example, Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans);
the lender is required by law to obtain an appraisal (see A3-2-01, Compliance With Laws);
the lender is using rental income from the subject property to qualify the borrower; or
the lender believes that an appraisal is warranted based on additional information the lender has about the property or subsequent events.
Note: The lender may not exercise a value acceptance (appraisal waiver) oﬀer if an appraisal is obtained for the transaction.
See B5-7-02, High LTV Reﬁnance Underwriting, Documentation, and Collateral Requirements for the New Loan for additional information about high LTV reﬁnance value acceptance (appraisal waiver).
Representations and Warranties
When a loan caseﬁle is eligible for value acceptance (appraisal waiver) and the oﬀer is exercised by the lender, Fannie Mae accepts the value estimate submitted by the lender as the value for the subject property. See A2-2-06, Representations and Warranties on Property Value for more information.
Rural High-Needs Value Acceptance (Appraisal Waiver)
In selected rural high-needs areas, Fannie Mae may oﬀer a value acceptance (appraisal waiver) through DU for certain transactions. This value acceptance (appraisal waiver) may be combined with other loan products, such as HomeReady.
The rural high-needs value acceptance (appraisal waiver) oﬀer will be considered for the following transactions only:
loan caseﬁles that receive an Approve/Eligible recommendation;
purchase transactions;
one-unit principal residence properties (excluding manufactured homes);
borrowers with income at or below 100% of the area median income; and
LTV ratios up to 97% and CLTV ratios up to 105% with a Community Seconds.
The following are ineligible for the rural high-needs value acceptance (appraisal waiver):
cash-out or limited cash-out reﬁnances;
second homes and investment properties; and
all other transactions that are ineligible for value acceptance (appraisal waiver) as listed above.
The following table provides the requirements related to the home inspection. These requirements must be met

Overview Eligible Transactions Ineligible Transactions Representations and Warranties Property Data Collection Property Data Collector Exercising Value Acceptance + Property Data Property Data Collection with Needed Repairs or Completion Veriﬁcation
Overview
For certain loan caseﬁles, DU oﬀers value acceptance + property data - an option that requires interior and
Published February 5, 2025
604
exterior property data collection to verify property eligibility prior to the note date. An appraisal is not required.
Eligible Transactions
Loan caseﬁles for certain one-unit properties will be considered for value acceptance + property data.
Ineligible Transactions
The following transactions are not eligible for value acceptance + property data:
two- to four-unit properties; co-op units; manufactured homes; proposed construction; construction-to-permanent loans (single-close and two-close); investment properties when rental income is used to qualify the borrower; HomeStyle Renovation and HomeStyle Energy loans; Texas 50(a)(6) loans; leasehold properties; community land trusts or other properties with resale price restrictions, which include loan caseﬁles using the Aﬀordable LTV feature; transactions where either the purchase price or estimated value provided to DU is $1,000,000 or more; transactions using gifts of equity; DU loan caseﬁles that receive an Ineligible recommendation; and manually underwritten loans.
Representations and Warranties
When a loan caseﬁle is eligible for value acceptance + property data and exercised by the lender, Fannie Mae accepts the value estimate submitted by the lender as the value for the subject property. See A2-2-06, Representations and Warranties on Property Value for more information.
Property Data Collection
The property data collection consists of a visual observation of the interior and exterior areas of the subject property. It must be performed by a trained and vetted property data collector and must adhere to the Uniform Property Dataset (UPD). This dataset consists of all required, conditionally required, and optional data elements for property data collection of subject property data including photos and a ﬂoor plan conforming to the ANSI Standard. See Gross Living Area in B4-1.3-05, Improvements Section of the Appraisal Report for ANSI standards, the Property Data Collection User Guide and Uniform Property Dataset (UPD) Speciﬁcation for more information.
After the property data collection is completed, it must be successfully submitted to Fannie Mae's Property Data API. See Fannie Mae's website for more information about the UPD and the Fannie Mae Property Data API and access.
Published February 5, 2025
605
Property Data Collector
The property data collector is the individual who personally visits the subject property to perform the property data collection guided by an application on a hand-held device developed in compliance with the UPD. The property data collector must identify and communicate any safety, soundness, or structural integrity issues and signiﬁcant items of incomplete construction or renovation.
Lender Vetting of Property Data Collectors
The lender must verify and be able to demonstrate that the data collectors are
selected in accordance with Fannie Mae requirements, including the Property Data Collector Independence Requirements, vetted through an annual background check, professionally trained, and they possess the essential knowledge to competently complete the property data collection.
The lender must ensure that the data collectors are trained to comply with their fair lending laws and deliver accurate results unaﬀected by personal biases. To avoid conﬂict of interest, the lender must ensure that the data collector has no interest in or ties to the underlying loan origination transaction, participants, or subject property.
The lender or lender's agent must review the data collector's credentials and qualiﬁcations on an annual basis to ensure ongoing compliance. Evidence of the reviews must be available to Fannie Mae upon request.
The lender must monitor and assess the work performed by the data collector through the lender's quality control program including prefunding and post-closing reviews. The lender must continually evaluate the quality of its property data collectors and property data collection (see D1-3-04, Lender Post-Closing Quality Control Review of Appraisers, Appraisals, Property Data Collectors, and Property Data Collection).
Exercising Value Acceptance + Property Data
A lender may only exercise value acceptance + property data when
the ﬁnal submission of the loan caseﬁle to DU resulted in an eligibility message for value acceptance + property data, property data collection is submitted to the Property Data API prior to the note date, an appraisal is not obtained for the transaction, and the oﬀer is not more than four months old on the date of the note and mortgage.
Lenders that elect to exercise value acceptance + property data must include Special Feature Code 774 at loan delivery. The property data collection is only valid for 12 months from date of collection and must be performed prior to the note date.
If the value acceptance + property data oﬀer is lost due to changes in qualifying loan characteristics after the property data collection was obtained, in some cases it may be possible for the lender to provide the property data collection to an appraiser to perform a hybrid appraisal assignment. See B4-1.2-03, Hybrid Appraisals for speciﬁc requirements. Alternatively, the lender may obtain a desktop or traditional appraisal report as speciﬁed
Published February 5, 2025

by DU.
Property Data Collection with Needed Repairs or Completion Veriﬁcation
The lender must represent and warrant that the property
does not have safety, soundness, or structural integrity issues; does not have signiﬁcant items of incomplete construction or renovation; and meets Fannie Mae's property eligibility requirements (see B2-3-01, General Property Eligibility).
To make these representations and warranties in the absence of an appraisal, the lender must examine the descriptive information and photo exhibits from the property data collection to determine whether the property meets the above requirements.
When the property data collection evidences any items failing eligibility requirements, the lender may need to obtain a professionally prepared report from a qualiﬁed professional to conﬁrm the eligibility of the property and if repairs are required (well, septic, foundation, roof, electrical, mold, etc.). If repairs or alterations are necessary to bring the property into compliance with Fannie Mae's eligibility requirements, the lender must provide satisfactory evidence and documentation showing the condition has been corrected or completed prior to sale of the loan to Fannie Mae.
See Form 1004D and Completion Alternatives in B4-1.2-05, Requirements for Verifying Completion and Postponed Improvements for the applicable requirements to verify completion of repairs, alterations, or inspections.

Chapter B4-2, Project Standards
Introduction
This chapter describes Fannie Mae’s project standards, policies, and requirements.
Section B4-2.1, General Project Standards
B4-2.1-01, General Information on Project Standards (11/06/2024)
Introduction This topic contains general information on Fannie Mae’s project standards, including:
Fannie Mae’s Project Risk Overview Project Documentation Condominium Project Questionnaire Project Types Project Review Methods Waiver of Project Review Requirements Applicable to All Properties in a Condo, Co-op, or PUD Project Priority of Common Expense Assessments Delivery Requirements Expiration for Project Reviews
Fannie Mae’s Project Risk Overview
The quality of mortgages secured by units in condo, co-op, and planned unit development (PUD) projects can be inﬂuenced by certain characteristics of the project or by the project as a whole. Before delivering a loan secured by an individual unit in a project, the lender must determine that the project meets Fannie Mae's eligibility requirements.
Project eligibility risk is a risk that is distinct from the credit risk presented by individual borrowers. Units located in a project present risks that are also distinct from the risks associated with properties that are not part of a homeowners’ association (HOA) or project. These risks include the following:
the ﬁnancial stability and viability of the project;
the condition and marketability of the project;
Published February 5, 2025
608
limitations on the unit owner’s ability to control the decision-making for the project, occupy the unit, or utilize the project’s amenities and common elements;
dissolution of the project and the unit owner’s resulting rights and responsibilities;
project-level litigation;
project-level misrepresentation and fraud;
the inability to cure a mortgage default due to restrictions in the project documents such as, but not limited to, right of ﬁrst refusal provisions; and
insurance coverage that is inadequate to protect the project from unexpected losses.
Project eligibility and ﬁnancial strength are key drivers of credit performance on individual unit mortgages and critical to the long-term success of the project. Fannie Mae’s project eligibility and underwriting requirements seek to mitigate project level risks and to ensure that projects are demonstrably well-managed.
Lenders that sell mortgage loans secured by units in a condo, co-op, or PUD project to Fannie Mae are expected to have staﬀ that are knowledgeable about and qualiﬁed to evaluate the speciﬁc risks presented by these types of projects. The project review is in addition to the review the lender completes for underwriting the borrower, the transaction terms, and the individual unit appraisal.
Fannie Mae’s project standards requirements are intended to address common project types across a broad geographic range. If a lender determines that a project does not meet all of Fannie Mae’s project eligibility criteria, but feels that the project has merit and warrants additional consideration, the lender may request an exception (see B4-2.2-07, Projects with Special Considerations and Project Eligibility Waivers, for additional information).
Project Documentation
The documentation needed to complete a project review may diﬀer depending on the project and review type. Lenders are responsible for determining the documentation needed to ensure that the project meets all of Fannie Mae’s eligibility requirements. Project documentation may include, but is not limited to, the following:
legal and recorded documents including the covenants, conditions and restrictions, declaration of condominium, or other similar documents that establish the legal structure of the project;
project budgets, ﬁnancial statements, and reserve studies;
project construction plans;
architects’ or engineers’ reports;
completion reports;
project marketing plans;
environmental hazard reports;
attorney opinions;
appraisal reports;
evidence of insurance policies and related documentation; and
condominium project questionnaires.
Published February 5, 2025
609
Sources for project information include, but are not limited to, appraisers, HOAs, co-op corporations, management companies, real estate agents, insurance professionals, and project developers. Lenders are responsible for the accuracy of any information obtained from these sources.
Document Retention
Lenders must retain all of the project documentation needed to demonstrate that the project meets Fannie Mae’s eligibility requirements, including any documentation the lender relied upon to enter information into CPM. This documentation must be retained, and made available upon request, as long as lenders originate mortgages from the project, and until all mortgages sold to Fannie Mae have been liquidated.
Condominium Project Questionnaire
The Condominium Project Questionnaire (Form 1076) helps lenders collect data to determine condo project eligibility. This form is optional; however, lenders are encouraged to use and retain the form in the loan ﬁle. A substantially similar form may also be used in its place.
Project Types
The scope of Fannie Mae’s requirements and the speciﬁc eligibility criteria to be met are dependent upon various project types and/or loan level characteristics. The characteristics that deﬁne each project type are described in the following table.
Project Type
Identiﬁcation Criteria
A project for which all of the following are true:
at least 90% of the total units in the project have been conveyed to unit
purchasers;
the project is 100% complete, including all units and common elements;
the project is not subject to additional phasing or annexation; and
control of the HOA has been turned over to the unit owners.
A project may also be treated as an established project with less than 90% of
the units sold to unit purchasers, provided the deﬁcit is the result of the
Established condo project
developer holding back units for rent. The following requirements must be
met:
construction is 100% complete;
the project is not subject to any additional phasing or annexation, and the
HOA has been turned over to the unit owners;
the developer’s share of the units held back for rental is no more than 20%
of the project’s total units;
HOA fees are paid current in developer-held units; and
there are no active or pending special assessments in the project.
Published February 5, 2025

Project Type
Identiﬁcation Criteria
A project for which one or more of the following is true:
fewer than 90% of the total units in the project have been conveyed to unit
purchasers (or 80% if it meets the exception noted in the row above);
the project is not fully completed, such as proposed construction, new

construction, or the proposed or incomplete conversion of an existing
building to a condo;
the project is newly converted;
the project is subject to additional phasing or annexation; or

See B4-2.3-01, Eligibility Requirements for Units in PUD Projects, for
additional detail used in determining whether a project is new or established
and subject to Fannie Mae’s PUD eligibility requirements.
Horizontal Property Regimes
Fannie Mae considers a development to be a condo project any time it is declared or ﬁled as a horizontal property regime in accordance with local statutes. Exception is made, if the local statute provides for the
Published February 5, 2025
611
horizontal property regime to be created as a PUD development and the project’s legal documents speciﬁcally state that the project is a PUD.
Lenders must determine if the subject unit is located in a condo or PUD and use the appropriate mortgage documents and appraisal forms.
Project Review Methods
Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes mortgage loans secured by units in condo, co-op, and PUD projects that meet Fannie Mae's eligibility requirements. To determine whether the project meets these requirements, a number of project review methods are available. Whether a project review method is allowable or required depends on
the number of units in the project (two- to four- or more than four);
the unit type (attached or detached);
the project type (condo, co-op, or PUD);
the project status (new or established); and
the mortgage transaction.
The characteristics that dictate which method to use are shown in the following table.

detached condo units;
units in a two- to four-unit condo project;
units in a PUD project, except for PUD projects consisting of single-width and/or multi-width manufactured homes subject to a community land trust, deed restriction, ground lease, or shared equity arrangement;

high LTV reﬁnance loans.
See B4-2.1-02, Waiver of Project Review for additional information and for the requirements that apply when a project review is waived.
Requirements Applicable to All Properties in a Condo, Co-op, or PUD Project
All mortgages secured by units in condo, co-op, or PUD projects must comply with the following:
requirements speciﬁc to the project review method used to determine that project’s eligibility;
property eligibility requirements (described in Chapter B2-3, Property Eligibility);
Published February 5, 2025
614
priority of common expense assessments (described below); and
when an appraisal of the property is obtained, it must meet all applicable appraisal requirements (described in Chapter B4-1, Appraisal Requirements).
Priority of Common Expense Assessments
Fannie Mae allows a limited amount of regular common expense assessments (typically known as HOA fees) to have priority over Fannie Mae’s mortgage lien for mortgage loans secured by units in a condo or PUD project. This applies if the condo or PUD project is located in a jurisdiction that has enacted
the Uniform Condominium Act,
the Uniform Common Interest Ownership Act, or
a similar statute that provides for unpaid assessments to have priority over ﬁrst mortgage liens.
The table below describes the permitted priority of common expense assessments for purposes of determining the eligibility of a mortgage loan secured by a unit in a condo or PUD project for purchase by Fannie Mae.
If the condo or PUD project...
Then...
the maximum number of months of regular common
expense assessments permitted under the applicable
is located in a jurisdiction that enacted a law on
jurisdiction’s law as of January 14, 2014, may have
or before January 14, 2014, that provides that
priority over Fannie Mae’s mortgage lien, provided
regular common expense assessments will have
that if the applicable jurisdiction’s law as of that date
priority over Fannie Mae’s mortgage lien for a
referenced an exception for Fannie Mae’s
maximum amount greater than six months,
requirements, then no more than six months of
regular common expense assessments may have
priority over Fannie Mae’s mortgage lien.
no more than six months of regular common expense
is located in any other jurisdiction,
assessments may have priority over Fannie Mae’s
mortgage lien, even if applicable law provides for a
longer priority period.
Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in the Guide, which do not require the lender to represent or warrant compliance with Fannie Mae project legal document requirements, the condo or PUD project legal documents must evidence compliance with the above priority of common expense assessment requirements.
Delivery Requirements
When delivering a loan for a unit located in a project, the lender must provide the Project Type Code and any applicable special feature codes as shown in the following table. The lender must also report all other applicable

Loans must be delivered to Fannie Mae within 120 days following the note date. When the elapsed time between note date and delivery date exceeds this limit, the lender may deliver the loan only if the project continues to meet Fannie Mae project eligibility requirements at the time of delivery.
Loans secured by units in a project that fails to meet Fannie Mae’s project eligibility requirements under the applicable review type as of the note date are eligible for delivery after the project comes into compliance with the eligibility requirements (provided all standard mortgage seasoning and other applicable requirements are met). For example, if a lender closes a loan in a new project for which the pre-sales are less than the pre-sale requirement, the lender may deliver the loan after the project’s pre-sales meet the Fannie Mae requirement (assuming the loan meets all other applicable requirements).

List of Ineligible Project Characteristics
Fannie Mae will not purchase or securitize mortgage loans that are secured by units in certain condo or co-op projects if those projects have characteristics that make the project ineligible. Such characteristics are described in the table below, with additional details provided in the sections that follow. All eligible projects must be created and remain in full compliance with state law and all other applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which the project is located.
Note: Loans secured by units in projects with a status of "Unavailable" in Condo Project Manager (CPM) are ineligible for purchase by Fannie Mae. If a lender determines that a project does not meet all of Fannie Mae’s project eligibility requirements but believes that the project has merit and warrants additional consideration, the lender may request an exception (see B4-2.2-07, Projects with Special Considerations and Project Eligibility Waivers, for additional information).

Projects that Operate as Hotels or Motels
A project may not be operated or managed as a hotel, motel, or similar commercial entity as evidenced by meeting one or more of the following criteria:
The HOA is licensed as a hotel, motel, resort, or hospitality entity.
The HOA or project’s legal documents restrict owners’ ability to occupy the unit during any part of the year.
The HOA or project’s legal documents require owners to make their unit available for rental pooling (daily or otherwise).
The HOA or the project’s legal documents require unit owners to share proﬁts from the rental of units with the HOA, management company, or resort, or hotel rental company.
In addition to the requirements above, any project with one or more of the following characteristics is ineligible. The project
is primarily transient in nature;
oﬀers hotel type services (including those oﬀered by or contracted through the HOA or management company) or characteristics such as registration services, rentals of units on a daily or short-term basis, daily cleaning services, central telephone service, central key systems and restrictions on interior decorating;
is a conversion of a hotel (or a conversion of a similar type of transient housing) unless the project was a gut rehabilitation and the resulting condo units no longer have the characteristics of a hotel or similar type of transient housing building;
Published February 5, 2025
624
is subject to voluntary rental-pooling, revenue, proﬁt or commission sharing agreements with the HOA or management company, or similar agreements that restrict the unit owner’s ability to occupy the unit such as blackout dates and occupancy limits to assure an inventory of units for rent on a frequent basis. This may include daily, weekly, monthly or seasonal restrictions;
is professionally managed by a hotel or resort management company that also facilitates short term rentals for unit owners or projects with management companies that are licensed as a hotel, motel, resort, or hospitality entity;
is deemed to be ineligible under Freddie Mac’s requirements because of condo hotel, resort, transient or short-term rental activity;
has a legal or common name that contains hotel, motel, or resort, unless the use of hotel, motel, or resort is a reference to a historical use of the building and not reﬂective of its current use as a residential condo or co-op project;
is marketed as a hotel, motel, resort or investment opportunity; or
has obtained a hotel or resort rating for its hotel, motel, or resort operations through hotel ratings providers including, but not limited to, travel agencies, hotel booking websites, and internet search engines.
The following criteria are examples of some common red ﬂags. The lender should perform additional due diligence of the project when any of these characteristics are present:
75% or more of the units are owned as investment and second home occupancy - especially when the loan transaction is not a principal residence transaction;
units that do not contain full-sized kitchen appliances;
advertisements for daily or short-term rental rates;
franchise agreements;
location of the project in a resort area;
units that are less than 400 square feet;
amenities that are common in hotels or resorts including spa services, concierge services, rentals of recreational equipment or amenities, childcare services for short-term renters, scheduled social or entertainment activities for short-term renters, airport shuttles, ski lift shuttles or ski lift and trail passes, or other vacation amenities and packages; or
interior doors that adjoin diﬀerent units.
Projects Subject to Split Ownership Arrangements
Projects with covenants, conditions, and restrictions that split ownership of the property or curtail an individual borrower’s ability to utilize the property are not eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae. These types of properties include, but are not limited to, the following:
“common interest” apartments or community apartment projects that are projects or buildings owned by several owners as tenants-in-common or by an association in which individuals have an undivided interest in a residential apartment building and land, and have the right of exclusive occupancy of a speciﬁc apartment in the building;
Published February 5, 2025
625
projects that restrict the owner’s ability to occupy the unit, even if the project is not being operated as a motel or hotel; and
projects with mandatory rental pooling agreements that require unit owners to either rent their units or give a management ﬁrm control over the occupancy of the units.
These are formal agreements between the developer, association, and/or the individual unit owners that obligate the unit owner to rent the property on a seasonal, monthly, weekly, or daily basis. In many cases, the agreements include blackout dates, continuous occupancy limitations, and other such use restrictions. In return, the unit owner receives a share of the revenue generated from the rental of the unit.
Projects that Contain Multi-Dwelling Unit Condos or Co-ops
Projects that contain multi-dwelling units are not permitted. These projects allow an owner to hold title (or share ownership and the accompanying occupancy rights) to a single legal unit that is sub-divided into multiple residential dwellings within the single legal unit, with ownership of the unit (or shares) evidenced by a single deed and ﬁnanced by a single mortgage (or share loan). The sub-divided units are not separate legal units. This restriction applies regardless if the unit owner maintains one or more of the sub-divided units as rental units or uses one or more of the sub-divided units as accessory or lock-out units.
This provision does not apply to condo or co-op projects that allow an individual to buy two or more individual legal units with the intent of structurally and legally combining the units for occupancy as a single-unit dwelling. Mortgages secured by units in these types of projects are eligible for purchase and securitization by Fannie Mae provided all of the following requirements are met:
The unit securing the mortgage represents a single legal unit under a single deed.
Any construction or renovation to structurally combine units has no material impact on the structural or mechanical integrity of the project’s buildings or the subject property unit.
The individual units must be fully described in the legal description in the mortgage and under a single deed.
The project’s legal documents must have been amended to reclassify the combined units as a single unit in the project.
All structural renovation to physically combine the units must be completed.
A condo or co-op unit with an accessory unit may be eligible on a case-by-case basis with a Fannie Mae PERS Project Approval or a loan-level project eligibility waiver. See B4-2.2-07, Projects with Special Considerations and Project Eligibility Waivers, for additional information on submitting an exception request.
Projects with Property that is not Real Estate
Fannie Mae acquires mortgage loans secured by real estate. Houseboats, boat slips, cabanas, timeshares, and other forms of property that are not real estate are not eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae. The marketability and value of individual units in a project may be adversely impacted by the inclusion of non-real estate property such as houseboats, timeshares, and other forms and structures that are not real estate. As such, projects containing these other non-real estate forms of property are not eligible.
Published February 5, 2025
626
Boat slips, cabanas, and other amenities are permitted when owned in common by the unit owners as part of the HOA.
Projects that Operate as a Continuing Care Community or Facility
Mortgages secured by units in a project that operates, either wholly or partially, as a continuing care community are ineligible for delivery to Fannie Mae. These communities or facilities are residential projects designed to meet specialized health and housing needs and typically require residents to enter into a lifetime contract with the facility to meet all future health, housing, or care needs. These communities may also be known by other names such as life-care facilities.
Projects that make continuing care services available to residents are eligible only if the continuing care facilities or services are not owned or operated by the HOA and residential unit owners are not obligated to purchase or utilize the services through a mandatory membership, contract, or other arrangement.
Continuing care communities are not the same as age-restricted projects. Age-restricted projects that restrict the age of residents but do not require residents to enter into a long-term or lifetime contract for healthcare and housing as the residents age are eligible.
Non-Incidental Business Arrangements
A condo project is ineligible if the HOA is receiving more than 10% of its budgeted income from non-incidental business arrangements related to the active ownership and/or operation of amenities or services available to unit owners and the general public. This includes, but is not limited to, businesses such as a restaurant or other food- and beverage-related services, health clubs, and spa services.
Non-incidental income from the following sources is permitted provided the income does not exceed 15% of the project’s budgeted income:
income from the use of recreational amenities or services owned by the HOA for the exclusive use by unit owners in the project or leased to another project according to a shared amenities agreement (as noted below), or
income from the leasing of units in the project acquired by the HOA through foreclosure.
The single-entity ownership limits (described above) will apply to the number of units owned and rented by the HOA.
Commercial Space and Mixed-Use Allocation
Fannie Mae requires that no more than 35% of a condo or co-op project or 35% of the building in which the project is located be commercial space or allocated to mixed-use. This includes commercial space that is above and below grade. Note that projects located in Special Flood Hazard Areas with commercial space greater than 25% of the project’s square footage, including any commercial parking facilities, may need supplemental or private ﬂood insurance policies to meet Fannie Mae’s requirements for ﬂood insurance. Coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program may provide inadequate coverage for projects with commercial space in excess of 25%. See B7-3-06, Flood Insurance Requirements for All Property Types for additional information.
Published February 5, 2025
627
Any commercial space in the project or in the building in which the residential project is located must be compatible with the overall residential nature of the project.
Note: Rental apartments and hotels located within the project must be classiﬁed as commercial space even though these may be considered “residential” in nature. Commercial parking facilities can be excluded from the commercial space calculation.
Calculation of Commercial Space. Commercial space allocation is calculated by dividing the total non- residential square footage by the total square footage of the project or building. Lenders are responsible for determining the total square footage of the project, the square footage of the non-residential space, and the residential space square footage. This calculation includes the total square footage of commercial space even if the residential and commercial owners are represented by separate associations.
Non-residential square footage includes:
retail and commercial space, and
space that is non-residential in nature and owned by a private individual or entity outside of the HOA structure.
Examples include, but are not limited to:
rental apartments,
hotels,
restaurants, and
private membership-based ﬁtness facilities.
Non-residential square footage excludes amenities that are:
residential in nature;
designated for the exclusive use of the residential unit owners (such as, but not limited to, a ﬁtness facility, pool, community room, and laundry facility); and
owned by the unit owners or the HOA.
The following table shows which commercial or mixed-use space must be included in the calculation of the percentage of commercial space.

Recreational Leases and Mandatory Memberships
Loans securing units in condo and co-op projects with mandatory memberships that require the HOA or co-op members to pay dues to a third-party organization (such as a golf course or other recreational facility) are ineligible for sale to Fannie Mae. The project must be the sole owner of its amenities, though certain exceptions will be allowed when there is a shared amenities agreement between HOAs or co-op projects.
Projects subject to recreational leases are also not eligible. A recreational lease is a long-term lease between
Published February 5, 2025
629
the HOA and a third party for access to certain recreational facilities for a speciﬁed time period and payment. In these scenarios, the owner of the facilities is often the project’s developer or has some ﬁnancial relationship to the developer and the leases often provide ongoing proﬁt to this party for the duration of the lease. The lease may permit the owner of the facilities to lease the amenities to other parties in addition to the HOA or co-op. The HOA or co-op may have certain ﬁnancial, insurance, and other legal obligations under the lease that may be burdensome over time. These leases may or may not provide the project long-term access to the amenities beyond the initial lease term.
When an HOA is part of a master association, the lender is required to evaluate whether the subject property’s HOA members are required to participate in a mandatory membership that is managed through the master association. Additionally, the master association may not be subject to recreational leases as described above.
Lenders are encouraged to review the project’s legal documents, sales contract, and budget to identify mandatory memberships and recreational leases. Some red ﬂags that a project may require a mandatory membership, or be a party to a recreational lease, is that the amenities may have some of the following characteristics:
the amenities have a diﬀerent name from the residential project and may be recognized as a diﬀerent legal entity from the HOA,
owners are required to pay large up-front fees to become a member or have access to the amenities,
owners are required to pay monthly or periodic dues to the entity that owns or operates the amenities (these dues may be paid directly to the owner or operator or they may be paid to the HOA and passed through to the owner or operator),
the general public may be able to purchase memberships or access passes for the use of the amenities,
the amenities can be leased or rented to the public for events not hosted by the HOA or its members, or
HOA members may be subject to block-out dates or other use restrictions.
Live-Work Projects
Live-work projects are projects that permit individual residential unit owners to operate and run a small business from their residential unit. Units in projects that permit live-work arrangements are eligible for sale to Fannie Mae provided the project complies with all applicable local zoning, program, or statutory requirements for live- work projects and the nature of the project is primarily residential.
Litigation or Pre-litigation Activity
Projects in which the HOA or co-op corporation is named as a party to pending litigation, or for which the project sponsor or developer is named as a party to pending litigation that relates to the safety, structural soundness, habitability, or functional use of the project are ineligible for sale to Fannie Mae.
If a lender discovers that a project is engaging in pre-litigation activities (such as, but not limited to, arbitration or mediation) that are reasonably expected to proceed to formal litigation; the lender must apply Fannie Mae’s litigation policies. Whether the legal action is resolved through arbitration, mediation, or it proceeds to litigation, there is risk that the project is exposed to material ﬁnancial hardship related to the matters addressed in the complaint.
Published February 5, 2025
630
If the lender determines that pending litigation involves minor matters with no impact on the safety, structural soundness, habitability, or functional use of the project, the project is eligible provided the litigation meets one or more of the following:
non-monetary litigation including, but not limited to neighbor disputes or rights of quiet enjoyment;
litigation for which the insurance carrier has agreed to provide the defense, and the amount is covered by the HOA's or co-op corporation's insurance;
the HOA or co-op corporation is the plaintiﬀ in the litigation and upon investigation and analysis the lender has reasonably determined the matter is minor and will result in an insigniﬁcant impact to the ﬁnancial stability of the project;
the reasonably anticipated or known damages and legal expenses are not expected to exceed 10% of the project’s funded reserves;
the HOA or co-op corporation is seeking recovery of funds for issues that have already been remediated, repaired, or replaced and there is no anticipated material adverse impact to the HOA or co-op corporation if funds are not recovered;
litigation concerning localized damage to a unit in the project that does not impact the overall safety, structural soundness, habitability, or functional use of the project; or
the HOA or co-op corporation is named as the plaintiﬀ in a foreclosure action, or as a plaintiﬀ in an action for past due HOA or co-op assessments.
Litigation that involves personal injury or death does not meet Fannie Mae’s criteria for minor litigation unless
the claim amount is reasonably anticipated or known,
the insurance carrier has agreed to provide the defense, and
the reasonably anticipated or known damages are covered by the HOA’s or co-op corporation’s insurance.
Construction defect litigation in which the HOA or co-op corporation is the plaintiﬀ are not considered a minor matter unless the HOA or co-op corporation is seeking recovery of funds for issues that have already been remediated, repaired, or replaced. In addition, there is no anticipated material adverse impact to the HOA or co- op if the funds are not recovered.
The lender must obtain documentation to support its analysis that the litigation meets Fannie Mae’s criteria for minor litigation as described above.
Single-Entity Ownership
A project meets the deﬁnition of single-entity ownership when a single entity (the same individual, investor group, partnership, or corporation) owns more than the following total number of units in the project:
projects with 5 to 20 units - 2 units
projects with 21 or more units - 20%
Units currently subject to any rental or lease arrangement must be included in the calculation. This includes lease arrangements containing provisions for the future purchase of units such as lease-purchase and rent-to-
Published February 5, 2025
631
own arrangements.
The following may be excluded from the single-entity ownership calculation:
units that are owned by the project sponsor or developer and are vacant and being actively marketed for sale; or
units that are controlled or owned by a non-proﬁt entity for the purpose of providing aﬀordable housing, units held in aﬀordable housing programs (including units subject to non-eviction rent regulation codes), or units held by higher-education institutions for a workforce housing program.
The single-entity ownership requirement may be waived when the transaction is a purchase transaction that will result in a reduction of the single-entity ownership concentration. In such instances, the following requirements must be met:
units owned by the single entity represent no more than 49% of the units;
evidence is required that the single entity is marketing units for sale to further reduce single-entity ownership, with the goal of reducing the concentration to 20% or less o the project units;
the single entity is current on all HOA assessments; and
there are no pending or active special assessments in the project.
Projects in Need of Critical Repairs
Projects in need of critical repairs are those needing repairs or replacements that signiﬁcantly impact the safety, soundness, structural integrity or habitability of the project's building(s), or the ﬁnancial viability or marketability of the project. Critical repairs include conditions such as:
material deﬁciencies, which if left uncorrected, have the potential to result in or contribute to critical element or system failure within one year; any mold, water intrusions or potentially damaging leaks to the project's building(s); advanced physical deterioration; any project that failed to pass state, county, or other jurisdictional mandatory inspections or certiﬁcations speciﬁc to structural safety, soundness, and habitability; or any unfunded repairs costing more than $10,000 per unit that should be undertaken within the next 12 months (does not include repairs made by the unit owner or repairs funded through a special assessment).
Examples of some items to consider include, but are not limited to, sea walls, elevators, waterprooﬁng, stairwells, balconies, foundation, electrical systems, parking structures or other load-bearing structures.
If damage or deferred maintenance is isolated to one or a few units and does not aﬀect the overall safety, soundness, structural integrity, or habitability of the project, then these requirements do not apply.
Routine repairs are not considered to be critical and include work that is:
preventative in nature or part of normal capital replacements (for example, focused on keeping the project fully functioning and serviceable); and accomplished within the project's normal operating budget or through special assessments that are
Published February 5, 2025
632
within guidelines.
A project with an evacuation order due to an unsafe condition, either for a partial or total evacuation of the project's building(s), is ineligible until the unsafe condition has been remediated and the building(s) is deemed safe for occupancy.
Special Assessments
Special assessments may be current or planned. Lenders must obtain and review the following information for each special assessment to determine if it addresses a critical repair:
what is the purpose of the special assessment, when was the special assessment approved and is it planned (approved by the unit owners, but not yet initiated by the board) or already being executed, what was the original amount of the special assessment and the remaining amount to be collected, and when is the expected date the special assessment will be paid in full.
If the special assessment is associated with a critical repair and the issue is not remediated, the project is ineligible.
Inspection Reports
If a structural and/or mechanical inspection was completed within 3 years of the lender's project review date, the lender must obtain and review the inspection report. The report cannot indicate that any critical repairs are needed, no evacuation orders are in eﬀect, and no regulatory actions are required.
If the inspection report indicates there are unaddressed critical repairs, the project is ineligible until the required repairs have been completed and documented accordingly. The lender must review an engineer's report or substantially similar document to determine if the repairs completed have resolved the safety, soundness, structural integrity, or habitability concerns of the project.
Documentation
Lenders may need to review a combination of documents to determine if a project meets Fannie Mae's physical condition requirements. Lenders are responsible for determining which documents are needed to ensure compliance with the requirements of this Guide. Some examples of this documentation include, but are not limited to:
HOA board meeting minutes, engineer report(s), structural and/or mechanical inspection reports, reserve studies, a list of necessary repairs provided by the HOA or the project's management company, a list of special assessments provided by the HOA or the project's management company, and other substantially similar documentation.

Overview
An environmental hazard assessment is required for condo and co-op projects if an environmental problem is identiﬁed by the lender through performance of its project underwriting or due diligence. If environmental problems are identiﬁed, the problems must be determined to be acceptable. Lenders should keep a copy of this assessment in the project review ﬁle.

Acceptability of Consultants
Fannie Mae reserves the right to notify lenders that a particular consultant is no longer acceptable. Fannie Mae also reserves the right to refuse to accept, at any time, any future environmental assessment, report, warranty, or certiﬁcation from individual consultants, speciﬁc consulting ﬁrms, or speciﬁc branch oﬃces of consulting ﬁrms.
Phase I Environmental Hazard Assessment
A Phase I assessment enables lenders to quickly determine whether adequate information exists to evaluate the environmental status of a property. A Phase I assessment is principally a screening process that focuses on reviewing the available documentation, interviewing people who are knowledgeable about the site operations, and inspecting the site, the building, and adjoining properties. Fannie Mae does not require a speciﬁc form for a Phase I assessment.
Any report that is thorough and professionally prepared will be acceptable. For a suggested format, see E-2-02, Suggested Format for Phase I Environmental Hazard Assessments.
Phase II Environmental Hazard Assessment Description
A Phase II assessment provides a more detailed review of the site. It includes speciﬁc physical sampling for each hazard that was not acceptable under the Phase I assessment, as well as a review of historical records. It determines the presence or absence of speciﬁc environmental liabilities (such as asbestos or leaking underground storage tanks) or quantiﬁes the extent of an observed or suspected environmental liability (such as soil or groundwater contamination).

Who Should Complete the Phase II Environmental Hazard Assessment
The specialized nature of the investigations conducted under a Phase II assessment requires the knowledge and experience of a qualiﬁed consultant.
Lenders must use care in choosing ﬁrms to perform environmental hazard assessments. Lenders should conﬁrm that the consultant it plans to use is not aﬃliated with the buyer or seller of the property or a ﬁrm engaged in a business that might present a conﬂict of interest. Lenders should also evaluate whether the consulting ﬁrm’s personnel have adequate and appropriate education and training to carry out the required duties.
Phase II Environmental Hazard Assessment Report Forms and Requirements
Fannie Mae does not specify an exact format for the consultant’s report. Any report that is thorough and professionally prepared will be acceptable.
The table below provides the requirements for the Phase II Environmental Assessment Report.
✓
The consultant’s report for a Phase II environmental hazard assessment report must
include a full description of the sampling procedures
include the laboratory results
include the consultant’s recommendations
follow all regulatory standards and good management practices at all times, especially when
physical sampling and laboratory analysis are involved
include a certiﬁcation in the report that:
the assessment was performed diligently and in accordance with all regulatory and good
management standards; and
to the best of the consultant’s knowledge, the results are complete and accurate
include the signature of an oﬃcer of the consulting ﬁrm that conducted the work
Kinds of Testing or Sampling Under Phase II Environmental Hazard Assessments

B4-2.1-06, Remedial Actions for Environmental Hazard Assessments
Below Standards (06/03/2020)
Introduction This topic contains information on remedial actions for environmental hazard assessments that are below standards, including:
Background Remedial Actions for Environmental Hazard Assessments Below Standards “No Further Action” Notices
Background
When an environmental hazard has been fully remediated, the hazard no longer poses any risks for future use of the land or structures or the need for ongoing activities to ensure human health and safety. Some hazards result in ongoing risks that require continual mitigation strategies to minimize potential harm. The environmental hazard is considered mitigated when those strategies suﬃciently minimize the current and future risks to human health and safety.
If the hazard will never be fully remediated but the impacts have been suﬃciently mitigated to satisfy applicable regulatory standards, the site may be deemed suitable and safe for residential use. The lender has the delegation to review the environmental hazard and its mitigation plan to determine if the project meets Fannie Mae’s requirements.
Remedial Actions for Environmental Hazard Assessments Below Standards
Properties that fail to meet a particular standard may be corrected through remedial actions and then retested. Remedial actions must be undertaken with the advice and written endorsement of a qualiﬁed environmental consultant. All remedial actions must be taken in accordance with all regulatory and good management standards.
Typically, lenders must conﬁrm the completion and eﬀectiveness of remedial actions based on the following conditions:
A qualiﬁed environmental consultant states in writing that remedial work needed to make the property eligible under the environmental standards can be completed within 90 days.
The project’s developer or sponsor signs a contract with a qualiﬁed ﬁrm to perform the remedial work within 90 days.
Published February 5, 2025
640
The lender must warrant that the job has been satisfactorily completed and the property meets Fannie Mae’s environmental eligibility standards.
If the property is not remediated at the time of project approval, the project developer or sponsor must provide a performance escrow equal to 150% of the gross contract amount to ensure the completion of the remedial work. Loans securing units in the project cannot be sold to Fannie Mae before completion of the remediation.
“No Further Action” Notices
Some jurisdictions or government agencies will issue a “no further action” notice (or letter) to alert the public that all available remediation steps for an environment hazard have been completed. A “no further action” status for a speciﬁc environmental hazard may indicate that
the hazard has been fully remediated and the site is suitable for residential development,
all applicable remediation actions have been taken but the site is not suitable for any type of development, or
other variations between these two opposing outcomes.
Due to the variation of what a “no further action” status means, lenders cannot rely solely on that status to determine if the environmental hazard has been suﬃciently resolved. For the project to meet Fannie Mae’s requirements, lenders must determine if the speciﬁc “no further action” condition has been suﬃciently resolved.
Lenders must follow Fannie Mae’s appraisal and notiﬁcation requirements for environmental hazards in B4-1.4-08, Environmental Hazards Appraisal Requirements, any time the subject property is impacted by an environmental hazard.

✓
Limited Review Eligibility Requirements
The project meets Requirements Applicable to All Properties in a Condo, Co-op, or PUD Project
described in B4-2.1-01, General Information on Project Standards.
The project is not an ineligible project. (See B4-2.1-03, Ineligible Projects).
The project does not consist of manufactured homes.
Note: Manufactured housing projects require a Fannie Mae PERS review or a Full Review.
No more than 15% of the total number of units in the project are 60 days or more past due in
the payment of each special assessment.
These requirements apply to both DU loan caseﬁles and manually underwritten loans.
If the project and loan transaction are eligible for and meet all of the eligibility requirements of the Limited Review process, the lender is not required to validate that the project also meets the eligibility requirements of another project review type. However, if the LTV, CLTV, or HCLTV ratios exceed the limits above, or in the event the lender becomes aware of a circumstance that would cause the project or transaction to be ineligible under a Limited Review, the lender must use one of the other project review methods to determine project eligibility and the project must meet all of the eligibility requirements of that selected alternate project review type.

CPM Status Designations CPM Delivery Restrictions Notiﬁcations Additional Obligations of the Lender for Projects Approved by Fannie Mae Full Review Eligibility Requirements Additional Requirements - For Condo Projects Consisting of Manufactured Homes Replacement Reserve Studies
Overview
The Full Review process is a method for the review of new and established condo projects, co-op projects, and certain manufactured home projects. Lenders performing a Full Review must ensure that the project meets all applicable eligibility requirements.
Unit and Project Types Eligible for Full Review
A Full Review may be performed when the unit securing the loan is an attached unit located in one of the following project types:
an established condo project, or
a new or newly converted condo project.
A Full Review may also be performed when the property securing the loan is a manufactured home in an established condo project that is not subject to a community land trust, deed restriction, ground lease, or shared equity arrangement.
These projects may also be reviewed by Fannie Mae through the PERS process (see B4-2.2-06, Project Eligibility Review Service (PERS)).
Full Review requirements for units in co-op projects are addressed in B4-2.3-02, Co-op Project Eligibility.
Condo Project Manager (CPM)
Lenders must use CPM to assist in their Full Review of a condo project (except for projects containing manufactured homes). CPM is a Web-based tool designed to facilitate the lender's review of the project to determine if it meets Fannie Mae's project eligibility requirements. The lender must complete their own certiﬁcation in CPM and document the loan ﬁle with the CPM decision by including the unexpired CPM Certiﬁcation in the ﬁle.
CPM certiﬁcations are based solely on the data that the lender enters into CPM. The lender is responsible for reviewing the applicable project documentation to obtain the information needed to complete the project review and enter the data into CPM. The lender is also responsible for ensuring that all data entered into CPM is correct and that the project meets all applicable Fannie Mae eligibility requirements.
CPM is available on Fannie Mae's website.

Ineligible
not eligible for sale to Fannie Mae.
Incomplete
Certiﬁcation
Project has been entered into CPM, but the lender's certiﬁcation process
has not been completed. The required information must be entered into
CPM for the lender to determine the project's eligibility.
CPM Delivery Restrictions Notiﬁcations
Project transaction eligibility or other loan-level restrictions will display in CPM. When CPM displays a delivery restriction for a speciﬁc project, lenders may only sell loans that comply with the stated restrictions.
Published February 5, 2025
645
For example, loans in some projects may be limited to certain occupancy types (such as principal residences only, or principal residences and second homes) or there may be limits on the LTV ratios.
Additional Obligations of the Lender for Projects Approved by Fannie Mae
If a lender becomes aware of any information that could impact the eligibility status reﬂected in CPM (such as, signiﬁcant deferred maintenance or major litigation), the lender must notify the CPM Management team (see E-1-02, List of Contacts) with the relevant data and information. Fannie Mae will evaluate the new information and its impact on eligibility. Before selling a loan secured by a unit in such a project, the lender must conﬁrm that the project retains its approved status. Notiﬁcation must occur as soon as practicable but no later than ﬁve business days after becoming aware of such information.
Fannie Mae reserves the right to change a project eligibility status designation if information acquired after approval or certiﬁcation has an impact on a previously issued eligibility determination.
Note: Lenders are responsible for verifying and documenting that the project meets the applicable insurance requirements described in Chapters B7-3 and B7-4. Fannie Mae does not review insurance policies as part of the review process.
Full Review Eligibility Requirements
When determining the eligibility of a condo project on the basis of a Full Review, lenders must ensure the condo project meets the eligibility requirements described in the following table.
✓
Full Review Eligibility Requirements
The project meets the Requirements Applicable to All Properties in a Condo, Co-op, or PUD
Project described in B4-2.1-01, General Information on Project Standards.
The project must not be an ineligible project as described in B4-2.1-03, Ineligible Projects.
No more than 15% of the total units in a project are 60 days or more past due on common
expense assessments (also known as HOA fees). For example, a 100–unit project may not
have more than 15 units that are 60 days or more past due.
This ratio is calculated by dividing the number of units with common expense assessments
that are past due by 60 or more days by the total number of units in the project.
No more than 15% of the total units in a project are 60 days or more past due in the payment
of each special assessment.
Published February 5, 2025
646
✓
Full Review Eligibility Requirements
Lenders must review the HOA projected budget to determine that it
is adequate (that is, it includes allocations for line items pertinent to the type of condo
project), and
provides for the funding of replacement reserves for capital expenditures and deferred
maintenance that is at least 10% of the budget.
To determine whether the association has a minimum annual budgeted replacement reserve
allocation of 10%, the lender must divide the annual budgeted replacement reserve allocation
by the association’s annual budgeted assessment income (which includes regular common
expense fees).
The following types of income may be excluded from the reserve calculation:
incidental income on which the project does not rely for ongoing operations, maintenance, or
capital improvements;
income collected for utilities that would typically be paid by individual unit owners, such as
cable TV or Internet access;
income allocated to reserve accounts; and
special assessment income.
The lender may use a reserve study in lieu of calculating the replacement reserve of 10%
provided the following conditions are met:
the lender obtains a copy of an acceptable reserve study and retains the study and the
lender’s analysis of the study in the project approval ﬁle,
the study demonstrates that the project has adequate funded reserves that provide ﬁnancial
protection for the project equivalent to Fannie Mae’s standard reserve requirements,
the study demonstrates that the project’s funded reserves meet or exceed the
recommendations included in the reserve study, and
the study meets Fannie Mae’s requirements for replacement reserve studies listed at the
end of this section.
For projects in which the units are not separately metered for utilities, the lender must
determine that having multiple units on a single meter is common and customary in the
local market where the project is located, and
conﬁrm that the project budget includes adequate funding for utility payments.
The project must be located on contiguous parcels of land. It is acceptable for a project to be
divided by public or private streets.
The structures within the project must be within a reasonable distance from each other.
Published February 5, 2025

✓
Full Review Eligibility Requirements
Common elements and facilities, such as recreational facilities and parking, must be
consistent with the nature of the project and competitive in the marketplace.
Unit owners in the project must have the sole ownership interest in, and rights to the use of
the project’s facilities, common elements, and limited common elements, except as noted
below.
Shared amenities are permitted only when two or more HOAs share amenities for the
exclusive use of the unit owners. The associations must have an agreement in place governing
the arrangement for shared amenities that includes the following:
a description of the shared amenities subject to the arrangement;
a description of the terms under which unit owners in the project may use the shared
amenities;
provisions for the funding, management, and upkeep of the shared amenities; and
provisions to resolve conﬂicts between the associations over the amenities.
Examples of shared amenities include, but are not limited to, clubhouses, recreational or
ﬁtness facilities, and swimming pools.
The developer may not retain any ownership interest in any of the facilities related to the
project. The amenities and facilities—including parking and recreational facilities—may not be
subject to a lease between the unit owners or the HOA and another party. Parking amenities
provided under commercial leases or parking permit arrangements with parties unrelated to
the developer are acceptable.
Fannie Mae permits the ﬁnancing of a single or multiple parking space(s) with the mortgage
provided that the parking space(s) and subject unit are included on one deed as evidenced on
the legal description in the mortgage. In such cases, the LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios are
based on the combined value of the residential unit and the parking space(s).
Phase I and II environmental hazard assessments are not required for condo projects unless
the lender identiﬁes an environmental problem through the performance of its project
underwriting or due diligence.
In the event that environmental problems are identiﬁed, the problems must be acceptable, as
described in E-2-02, Suggested Format for Phase I Environmental Hazard Assessments.
Published February 5, 2025

✓
Full Review Eligibility Requirements
For investment property transactions in established projects at least 50% of the total units in
the project must be conveyed to principal residence or second home purchasers. This
requirement does not apply if the subject mortgage is for a principal residence or second
home.
Financial institution-owned REO units that are for sale (not rented) are considered owner-
occupied when calculating the 50% owner-occupancy ratio requirement.
If the project was a gut rehabilitation project, all rehabilitation work involved in a condo
conversion must have been completed in a professional manner.
“Gut rehabilitation” refers to the renovation of a property down to the shell of the structure,
including the replacement of all HVAC and electrical components (unless the HVAC and
electrical components are up to current code).
For a conversion that was legally created during the past three years, the architect’s or
engineer’s report (or functional equivalent), that was originally obtained for the conversion
must comment favorably on the structural integrity of the project and the condition and
remaining useful life of the major project components, such as the heating and cooling
systems, plumbing, electrical systems, elevators, boilers, roof, etc.
For additional information applicable to condo projects subject to a ground lease, see B2-3-03,
Special Property Eligibility and Underwriting Considerations: Leasehold Estates.
Note: If the project is a newly converted non-gut rehabilitation project with more than four
residential units, lenders must submit the project to Fannie Mae for review and approval. See
B4-2.2-06, Project Eligibility Review Service (PERS), for additional information.
Additional Requirements - For Condo Projects Consisting of Manufactured Homes
When determining the eligibility of condo project consisting of manufactured homes on the basis of a Full Review, lenders must ensure the property and project meet the eligibility requirements described in the following table.
✓
Additional Requirements for Condo Projects Consisting of Manufactured Home Units
As described in B4-2.2-06, Project Eligibility Review Service (PERS), certain manufactured
home projects must be submitted to PERS. Lenders must perform a pre-PERS submission
review to conﬁrm the project meets the Full Review and other requirements.
Published February 5, 2025
649
✓
Additional Requirements for Condo Projects Consisting of Manufactured Home Units
The condo project must meet all Full Review requirements, as applicable.
CPM should not be used to complete the Full Review because it does not contain all the
requirements that apply to condo projects consisting of manufactured homes.
The project must not contain campgrounds or other facilities for transient or mobile units.
The project legal documents must require a provision for land-lease “hold-out” units to be
converted into the condo structure upon transfer, sale, or reﬁnance of property. Land lease
“hold-out” units are limited to 25% or less of the total units in the project.
Land-lease hold-out units are units where the structure is owned by an individual, but the land
is leased from the HOA or project sponsor. These units were not converted to condo ownership
when the project converted to a condo regime.
Replacement Reserve Studies
Reserve studies may be used to determine the appropriate level of reserves the HOA must maintain to ensure the project’s long-term success. Reserve studies will also provide useful information regarding the adequacy of the HOA’s current reserve funds and oﬀer recommendations to meet funding goals in the event the HOA has under-reserved for its needs in the past. The lender may review the most current reserve study or a reserve study update provided it has been completed within three years of the date on which the lender approves the project.
Reserve studies must be prepared by an independent third party that has speciﬁc expertise in completing reserve studies. This expertise may include any of the following:
a reserve study professional with reserve study credentials,
a construction engineer,
a certiﬁed public accountant who specializes in reserve studies, or
any professional with demonstrated knowledge of and experience in completing reserve studies.
While Fannie Mae does not require that a standard format be used for the reserve study, the following items must be addressed:
all major components and elements of the project’s common areas for which repair, maintenance, or replacement is expected;
the condition and remaining useful life of each major component;
an estimate of the cost of repair, replacement, restoration, or maintenance of major components;
an estimate of the total annual contributions required to defray costs (minus the existing reserves funded for this purpose), including inﬂation;
an analysis of existing funded reserves; and
Published February 5, 2025
650
a suggested reserve funding plan.
Note: Individual states may have various statutes concerning the use and content of reserve studies. Fannie Mae requires that a reserve study used by the lender in its analysis meet or exceed requirements set forth in relevant state statutes.

Full Review Requirements – For Units in New or Newly Converted Condo Projects
The project, or the subject legal phase, must be “substantially complete” unless other
completion arrangements have been approved by Fannie Mae through the PERS review
process.
There may not be more than one legal phase per building.
“Substantially complete” means that
a certiﬁcate of occupancy or other substantially similar document has been issued by the
applicable governmental agency for the project or subject phase; and
all the units and buildings in the legal phase in which the unit securing the mortgage is
located are complete, subject to the installation of buyer selection items, such as appliances.
Note: Fannie Mae does not require the installation of typical buyer selection items such as
appliances, ﬂoor coverings, counter tops, or light ﬁxtures that are common and customary for
the market, although buyer selections that involve the modiﬁcation of a unit ﬂoor plan must
be complete. Lenders are expected to obtain appropriate documentation to verify that all
buyer selection items for the unit being ﬁnanced are properly installed prior to closing.
At least 50% of the total units in the project or subject legal phase must have been conveyed
or be under contract for sale to principal residence or second home purchasers.
For a speciﬁc legal phase or phases in a new project, at least 50% of the total units in the
subject legal phase(s), considered together with all prior legal phases, must have been
conveyed or be under contract for sale to principal residence or second home purchasers.
For the purposes of this review process, a project consisting of one building cannot have
more than one legal phase.
Individual units in new condo projects must be available for immediate occupancy at the time
of loan closing.
If the project is part of a larger development, and the unit owners are required to pay monthly
assessments of more than $50 to a separate master association for that development, lenders
must review the overall development plan for the master association to evaluate the
acceptability of the project.
The overall development plan of the project must be reviewed and the following must be
acceptable:
consistency of future and existing improvements,
time limitations for expansion, and
reciprocal easements between legal phases.

Full Review Requirements – For Units in New or Newly Converted Condo Projects
For projects (or the subject legal phase) that are only substantially complete rather than 100%
complete, lenders must determine that acceptable completion assurance arrangements that
guarantee the future completion of all project facilities, common elements, and limited
common elements have been provided. These assurance arrangements may include
cash deposits,
letters of credit,
assignments of certiﬁcates of deposit, or
assignments of other assets that can be easily converted to cash.
Similar arrangements must be provided to support assurances against construction and
structural defects. The assurances must
protect each unit against defects that become apparent within one year from the date of its
settlement, and
cover all common facilities for one year from the date on which units that represent at least
60% of the votes in the HOA have been transferred.
The developer or sponsor should provide for and promote the unit owners’ early participation
in the management of the project.
The project must meet the condo project legal document requirements in the following
section.

Condo Project Legal Document Review Requirements - For Units in New or Newly Converted Condo Projects
Required provisions related to amendments to project documents
are as follow:
The project documents must provide that amendments of a
material adverse nature to mortgagees be agreed to by
mortgagees that represent at least 51% of the votes of unit
estates that are subject to mortgages.
The project documents must provide for any action to terminate
the legal status of the project after substantial destruction or
condemnation occurs or for other reasons to be agreed to by
mortgagees that represent at least 51% of the votes of the unit
estates that are subject to mortgages.
Amendments to Documents
The project documents may provide for implied approval to be
assumed when a mortgagee fails to submit a response to any
written proposal for an amendment within 60 days after it
receives proper notice of the proposal, provided the notice was
delivered by certiﬁed or registered mail, with a return receipt
requested. Notwithstanding the foregoing, project documents that
were recorded prior to August 23, 2007, may provide for implied
approval to be assumed when a mortgagee fails to submit a
response to any written proposal for an amendment within 30
days after it receives proper notice of the proposal, provided the
notice was delivered by certiﬁed or registered mail, with a return
receipt requested.

Waivers (11/10/2014)
Introduction This topic contains information on projects with special considerations and project eligibility waivers, including:
Projects with Special Considerations Project Eligibility Waivers
Projects with Special Considerations
Lenders may identify projects that merit special consideration even though the project characteristics do not meet all of the Fannie Mae eligibility requirements. In these instances, lenders can contact the Fannie Mae Project Standards team to discuss the possibility of accepting such projects. Exceptions to Fannie Mae eligibility and underwriting requirements are considered on a project-by-project basis.
Project Eligibility Waivers
If the lender believes that a speciﬁc eligibility requirement should be waived for a particular project with respect to a single loan, then the lender must
ﬁrst enter the project into CPM before requesting a waiver through the Credit Variance Administration System (CVAS), and
request a waiver from Fannie Mae through CVAS.
Fannie Mae’s Project Standards team will determine if a single loan project eligibility waiver is warranted. Fannie Mae charges a nonrefundable $200 review fee for each waiver request. A higher review fee may be charged based on the complexity of the waiver review.
Note: Project eligibility waivers are typically issued only for established projects, though Fannie Mae at its sole discretion reserves the right to allow this type of waiver for a unit in a new project on a case- by-case basis. New or newly converted projects must be reviewed for eligibility through an eligible lender review process or by Fannie Mae through the PERS submission process. Lenders must not request a project eligibility waiver for a unit in a new project to circumvent the required review for new projects.

Introduction This topic contains information on PUD projects, including:
PUD Project Requirements Eligibility Requirements for Units in PUD Projects
PUD Project Requirements
For a project to qualify as a PUD, all of the following requirements must be met:
each unit owner’s membership in the HOA must be automatic and nonseverable,
the payment of assessments related to the unit must be mandatory,
common property and improvements must be owned and maintained by an HOA for the beneﬁt and use of the unit owners, and
the subject unit must not be legally created as part of a condo or co-op project.
Zoning is not a basis for classifying a project or subdivision as a PUD. Units in projects or subdivisions simply zoned as PUDs that include the following characteristics are not deﬁned as PUD projects under Fannie Mae’s policies. These projects
have no common property and improvements,
do not require the establishment of and membership in an HOA, and
do not require the payment of assessments.
Fannie Mae classiﬁes PUD projects as either
Type E—established PUD projects in which the developer has turned over voting control of the HOA to the unit purchasers.
Type F—new PUD projects in which the developer has not turned over voting control of the HOA to the unit purchasers.
Certain PUD projects require submission to PERS. See B4-2.2-06, Project Eligibility Review Service (PERS) for

New or established PUD projects consisting of single-width and/or multi-width manufactured homes not subject to a community land trust, deed restriction, ground lease, or shared equity arrangement may be reviewed in accordance with B4-2.1-02, Waiver of Project Review.
Eligibility Requirements for Units in PUD Projects
Lenders must determine that the PUD project and subject unit meet the requirements described in Requirements Applicable to All Properties in a Condo, Co-op, or PUD Project in B4-2.1-01, General Information on Project Standards.
Note: Any unit legally created as part of a condo or co-op project located within a larger PUD project or master association must meet the applicable requirements for condo or co-op projects.

Co-op Project Eligibility Overview
Published February 5, 2025

Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes co-op share loans for units in co-op projects from lenders specially approved to sell such loans to Fannie Mae. Lenders must determine the acceptability of a co-op project, unless the project is comprised of manufactured homes or is a project that is a newly converted non-gut rehabilitation of a co-op project. Such projects must be submitted via the Project Eligibility Review Service (PERS) to Fannie Mae for review.
The lack of available co-op project data and the inconsistent reporting of co-op project information can be a barrier to obtaining aﬀordable ﬁnancing for co-op housing. Lenders are responsible for determining the most appropriate method for obtaining information about co-op projects and the accuracy of the information they obtain.
For additional information, see:
A2-1-01, Contractual Obligations for Sellers/Servicers,

Request for Co-op Project Information
The Request for Cooperative Project Information ( Form 1074) includes the project information that lenders, investors, and mortgage insurers may use in their evaluation of the eligibility of a co-op project, and provides an eﬃcient means of collecting basic project information from co-op project management agents, boards of directors, or sponsors/developers.
Eligibility Requirements for Co-op Projects
The table below provides project eligibility requirements for co-op projects.
✓
Full Review Eligibility Requirements – For New and Established Co-op Projects
In order for a co-op share loan to be eligible for sale, the co-op project in which the secured
unit is located must qualify as a cooperative housing corporation under Section 216 of the
Internal Revenue Service Code. The lender’s loan or project approval ﬁle must contain
evidence regarding the project’s compliance with Section 216.
Note: If the co-op project does not meet Section 216 requirements, Fannie Mae will not
purchase a co-op share loan from within the project.
Published February 5, 2025
670
✓
Full Review Eligibility Requirements – For New and Established Co-op Projects
The co-op housing project must
be designed principally for residential use;
consist of two or more units; and
be located in an area that has a demonstrated market acceptance for the co-op form of
ownership, as reﬂected by the availability of similar comparable sales for co-op units in the
market area.
The project may be owned in fee simple or be a leasehold estate (subject to a ground lease).
Note: For additional information applicable to co-op projects subject to a ground lease, see
B2-3-03, Special Property Eligibility and Underwriting Considerations: Leasehold Estates
The lender is responsible for determining that the co-op cooperation holds title to the property
of the co-op project, including the dwelling units. A type of co-op project that does not meet
these requirements is one in which the borrower, not the co-op corporation, owns their
dwelling unit in the project. Co-op share loans in these projects are commonly referred to as
“land-home” or “land-lease” co-op projects and require special approval for delivery to Fannie
Mae.
The co-op corporation must have good and marketable title to the property, including the
dwelling units and amenities. The project premises must be free and clear of liens and
encumbrances in accordance with B7-2-05, Title Exceptions and Impediments.
The blanket project mortgage may be a market-rate FHA-insured mortgage or a conventional
mortgage.
The blanket mortgage for the project may be a balloon mortgage. The remaining term may
not be less than six months. If the balloon mortgage incorporates an adjustable-rate feature,
and the remaining term is less than three years but not less than six months, the current
interest rate may not be subject to an interest rate adjustment prior to the maturity date.
Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes co-op share loans regardless of whether Fannie Mae owns
the blanket mortgage. However, if Fannie Mae owns an interest in the blanket co-op project
mortgage, the maximum mortgage amount available to the borrower must be reduced by the
portion of the unpaid principal balance of the blanket mortgage(s) that is attributable to the
subject unit’s ownership interest.
Fannie Mae will not purchase or securitize co-op share loans if the co-op project is an ineligible
project type, regardless of the characteristics of the share loan. See B4-2.1-03, Ineligible
Projects.
Published February 5, 2025

✓
Full Review Eligibility Requirements – For New and Established Co-op Projects
The project must not be a manufactured housing project.
The project must meet Fannie Mae’s insurance requirements, as stated in Subpart B7,
Insurance.
Co-op projects may be newly constructed or conversions of existing buildings.
All newly converted non-gut rehabilitation of co-op share projects must be approved through
the PERS process.
A newly converted non-gut rehabilitation co-op project is deﬁned as follows:
a project for which the building has been recently converted from another use such as, but
not limited to, apartment use, hotel building, or warehouse;
the renovation work did not involve structural or functional changes, such as the
replacement of all HVAC and electrical components and was limited to cosmetic or design
changes such as painting, ﬂooring, and appliances; and,
the project meets the criteria for being a new project because any of the following conditions
exist with respect to the status of the project:
⚬ fewer than 90% of the stock or shares have been sold to purchasers;
⚬ the developer or sponsor is in control of the co-op corporation;
⚬ the project is not fully completed, such as proposed construction, new construction, or
the proposed or incomplete conversion of an existing building to a co-op; or
⚬ the project is subject to additional phasing or annexation.
The following newly converted projects may be reviewed by the lender through the standard
co-op review process rather than being submitted to PERS:
any non-gut rehabilitation conversion project that was converted at least three years prior to
the co-op share loan note date that is considered “newly converted” solely because more than
20% of the stock or shares are owned by the sponsor as described in the single entity
ownership provisions in B4-2.3-05, Geographic-Speciﬁc Co-op Project Considerations; and
two- to four-unit non-gut rehabilitation conversions.
All units, common areas, and facilities within the project must be 100% complete. The project
cannot be subject to additional phasing or annexation. All construction and rehabilitation for
the project must be completed in a professional manner before Fannie Mae purchases or
securitizes the share loan, unless the Project Standards Team approves delivery at an earlier
date.

Phase I and II environmental hazard assessments are not required for co-op projects unless
the lender identiﬁes an environmental problem through the performance of its project
underwriting and due diligence.
In the event that environmental problems are identiﬁed, the problems must be determined to
be acceptable, as described in E-2-02, Suggested Format for Phase I Environmental Hazard
Assessments.
Stock, share, or other contractual agreement evidencing ownership, and the accompanying
occupancy rights that represent at least 50% of the total number of stock or shares in the co-
op corporation and the related occupancy rights of units in the project must have been sold
and conveyed (or, for new construction, must be under contract for sale) to principal residence
purchasers.
The project’s most recent operating budget, audited ﬁnancial statements, or corporate tax
returns must
be consistent with the nature of the project,
provide for adequate cash ﬂow to service the current debt and operating expenses, and
provide for adequate replacement and operating reserves.
If the most recent budget is not available, the lender may rely on a review of the co-op
corporation’s most recent audited ﬁnancial statements or corporate tax returns to determine
that the ﬁnancial requirements in this section have been met.
The project must have a good ﬁnancial record, with no more than 15% of the owners being
more than 60 days past due in the payment of their ﬁnancial obligations to the co-op
corporation. Note: This includes payment of each special assessment.
If the project is a recipient of subsidies or similar beneﬁts (such as tax or assessment
abatements) that will terminate partially or fully within the next three years, the lender must
evaluate the impact the expiration of such beneﬁt will have on the project. If the beneﬁt is
scheduled to expire within three years from the note date, the lender must include the higher
monthly fees in the borrower’s monthly liabilities for debt-to-income ratio qualifying purposes.
The project and share loan documentation must comply with any speciﬁc legal requirements
established for the state in which the project is located.

674
Co-op Membership Lien Position for Co-op Share Loans Prior Co-op Financing Assignment of Co-op’s Lease/Occupancy Rights Co-op Corporation’s Recognition Agreement, Responsibilities, and Lender’s Rights Lender’s Rights
Amendments to Documents
The co-op project’s documents must provide for the tenant-stockholders to have the right to amend them. In addition, the co-op corporation must be legally bound to notify the holder of a co-op share loan about any proposed material changes to the co-op project with respect to allocation of membership interests, voting rights, insurance coverages, and any other provisions that are for the express beneﬁt of the lender.
Co-op Membership
The project documents must require that the sale or transfer of stock, shares, or membership certiﬁcates in the co-op corporation be in compliance with federal and state security disclosure laws. The documents also must require tenant-stockholders to own stock, shares, or a membership certiﬁcate, and permit the stock, shares, or membership certiﬁcates in the co-op corporation to be pledged and registered.
The project documents must give the tenant-stockholder a right to occupy the unit for a period that extends at least to the maturity date of the share loan, although this right should be subject to the terms and conditions of a proprietary lease or occupancy agreement between the tenant-stockholder and the co-op corporation. The documents also must prohibit the co-op corporation from imposing unreasonable limitations on the tenant- stockholder’s ability to sell, transfer, or convey their membership, or to sublease their unit. If the purchaser’s right to membership or occupancy is subject to any right of the co-op corporation to give approval, the lender must furnish evidence to clearly show that such approval has been given before Fannie Mae will purchase or securitize the co-op share loan.
Lien Position for Co-op Share Loans
The share loan must be secured by the assignment (in pledge or trust) of the borrower’s leasehold estate; a pledge or trust of the corporation stock, shares, or membership certiﬁcate; and any other documents that are appropriate under individual state or local laws and practices.
The lender that is ﬁnancing the share loan must receive an assignment of the proprietary lease, occupancy agreement, or other similar evidence of the right to occupy the unit for all share loans that it delivers to Fannie Mae. The lender must also obtain a stock power, assignment, or other similar document that authorizes the lender to transfer ownership interest in the event of a default. Valid ﬁnancing statements and assignments of ﬁnancing statements must be executed and ﬁled, if necessary to perfect Fannie Mae’s security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code of the state in which the property is located. Information searches or equivalent evidence of ﬁling ﬁnancing statements and assignments of ﬁnancing statements must be obtained and must show that the Fannie Mae co-op share loan is in ﬁrst-lien position. In those states in which co-op units are considered real property, perfection of the lien must comply with state law applicable to real estate.
Published February 5, 2025
675
The share loan must be a ﬁrst-lien, except that, where custom dictates to the contrary, Fannie Mae will permit its lien to be subordinate to the co-op corporation’s lien against the tenant-stockholder’s shares for unpaid assessments that represents the pro rata share of the corporation’s payments for the blanket mortgage, current year’s real estate taxes, operating expenses or maintenance fees, and special assessments.
Note: The pro rata share of the project debt that is related to the co-op share loan cannot exceed 35% of the sum of the related pro rata share of the project debt and the appraised equity interest value of the shares. Lenders may use a higher ratio (not to exceed 40%) when there are fully documented compensating factors that justify using the higher ratio.
Fannie Mae will also permit its lien to be subordinate to any assignment of rents or maintenance expenses in any mortgage or deed of trust that is secured by the co-op project, or any Regulatory Agreement entered into by the co-op corporation and the Secretary of HUD as a condition for obtaining HUD mortgage insurance.
Prior Co-op Financing
The co-op project must be in compliance with the requirements imposed by the holder of any prior ﬁnancing for the project. If the blanket mortgage on a project includes a due-on-encumbrance clause and the project is located in a state in which share loans are considered to be an encumbrance on the project, the blanket lender must consent to the share loan ﬁnancing. In the case of a conversion of an existing building, the blanket lender must agree to the use of the building as a co-op and, if it is feasible, agree—in the event of a default on the blanket mortgage—not to wipe out the shares of those tenant-stockholders who are current in the payment of their assessments or carrying charges.
Assignment of Co-op’s Lease/Occupancy Rights
Generally, the project documents should not permit the co-op corporation to restrict the sale, conveyance, or transfer of a unit owned by a lender, its successors, or assigns, nor to place any limits on the assignment of the proprietary lease or occupancy agreement to the lender, its successors, or assigns. This lease or agreement must be assumable by the lender if the tenant-stockholder defaults on the share loan. If the co-op’s organizational documents require that a tenant-stockholder be a natural person, they must permit the lender to select a non-corporate designee for any assignment of a proprietary lease or occupancy agreement that it acquires through foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. If the lender assumes the lease or agreement as the result of the tenant-stockholder’s default, the co-op corporation must allow the lender to attempt to sell its interest in the lease or agreement. However, if the lender is unable to eﬀect a satisfactory sale within 60 days—either through its own eﬀorts or with assistance from the co-op corporation—the co-op corporation may not prohibit the lender from subletting the unit.
The project documents may grant the co-op corporation the right to approve a lender’s sublessee or to oﬀer an alternate sublessee that is satisfactory to the lender. However, the co-op corporation’s approval standards and procedures may not be unreasonably restrictive or in violation of applicable law, and the action must be completed within a reasonable time after the lender requests approval of a proposed sublessee.
Co-op Corporation’s Recognition Agreement, Responsibilities, and Lender’s Rights
Published February 5, 2025
676
The project documents must either require the co-op corporation to execute a separate agreement—such as a recognition agreement—or include provisions to recognize speciﬁc rights of the lender that ﬁnances the share loan (or those of its successors or assigns) and the co-op corporation’s responsibilities to that lender.
Co-op Corporation’s Responsibilities
The recognition agreement or other legal agreement (or the project’s legal documents) must include, among other things, the following responsibilities for the co-op corporation:
The co-op corporation must evict a tenant-stockholder who has defaulted on their share loan and must terminate that tenant-stockholder’s lease, if the share loan holder requests it to do so.
The co-op corporation must be legally bound to notify the lender of any of the following changes or occurrences:
any threatened or actual condemnation, eminent domain proceeding or acquisition, or any actual loss, whether or not covered by insurance, that aﬀects any portion of the co-op project or unit;
failure to maintain compliance with co-operative corporation eligibility under IRS Code Section 216;
any 30-day delinquency by the co-op corporation in payments due under any blanket mortgage for real estate taxes, assessments, and charges imposed by a government entity or public utility, or under any ground lease;
any lapse or cancellation of any insurance coverages maintained by the co-op project;
any proposed action that requires the consent of a speciﬁed percentage of eligible share loan holders; and
any 90-day delinquency by the tenant-stockholder that is related to the payment of their monthly assessments or carrying charges.
If the co-op project is subject to a ground lease, in the event of a condemnation or similar taking proceeding aﬀecting any portion of the co-op project or the unit, the co-op corporation must protect the lender's ﬁnancial interest.
Lender’s Rights
The project documents must grant the lender ﬁnancing a share loan the right to cure the tenant-stockholder’s defaults in their assessment payments or carrying charges and the right to review and approve the following actions before the co-op corporation can consent to them:
any surrender, cancellation, modiﬁcation, or assignment of any documents evidencing ownership, possession, and use of a unit;
any sublease of a unit;
any further or additional pledge or mortgage of any documents evidencing ownership, possession, and use of a unit;
any action to change the form of ownership of the project; or
the contraction, expansion, or termination of the co-op project.

B4-2.3-04, Loan Eligibility for Co-op Share Loans (08/07/2018)
Introduction This topic contains information on loan eligibility for co-op share loans, including:
Overview Co-op Share Loan Eligibility Requirements Calculating the LTV Ratio for Co-op Share Loans Co-op Share Loans Subject to Flip Tax Co-op Share Loan Documentation Whole Loan and MBS Delivery Requirements
Overview
Co-op share loans ﬁnance the purchase or reﬁnancing of the borrower’s ownership interest in a co-op housing corporation and accompanying occupancy rights in a residential unit in a co-op project owned by the co-op housing corporation. The property that secures Fannie Mae’s ﬁrst lien is the borrower’s ownership interest in a co-op housing corporation that is represented by stock or shares in the co-op housing corporation (or by a membership certiﬁcate or other contractual agreement evidencing ownership) and an assignment of the borrower’s rights under a proprietary lease or occupancy agreement with the co-op housing corporation.
Co-op Share Loan Eligibility Requirements
Fannie Mae will purchase co-op share loans provided borrowers occupy the property as a principal residence or second home. Investment properties are prohibited. Fannie Mae does not purchase or securitize co-op share loans that are subject to subordinate ﬁnancing except for high LTV reﬁnance transactions.
For the applicable credit score, minimum reserve requirements, and maximum debt-to-income ratio requirements, see the Eligibility Matrix.
Calculating the LTV Ratio for Co-op Share Loans
Published February 5, 2025
678
The method for calculating the LTV ratio for a co-op share loan is based on whether the borrower assumes their pro rata share of the blanket mortgage or does not. In those markets where the borrower assumes their pro rata share of the blanket mortgage, the LTV ratio is determined by dividing the original loan amount by the lower of
the sales price for the co-op unit (unencumbered by the unit’s pro rata share of the co-op project’s blanket mortgage(s)), or
the appraised value of the co-op stock or shares and the related occupancy rights (unencumbered by the unit’s pro rata share of the project’s blanket mortgage(s)).
In those markets where the borrower does not assume their pro rata share of the blanket mortgage, then the LTV ratio is determined by dividing the original loan amount by the lower of
the sales price for the co-op unit, or
the appraised value of the co-op stock or shares and the related occupancy rights.
Co-op Share Loans Subject to Flip Tax
Co-op share loans secured by units in co-op projects that require the payment of a “ﬂip tax” are eligible for delivery as long as the co-op project’s legal documents permit the imposition of a ﬂip tax and provide for one of the following:
the lender is exempt from paying the ﬂip tax if the lender acquires the co-op unit in foreclosure, in a transfer by the borrower in lieu of foreclosure, or any other transfer of the borrower’s interest in the co-op unit in full or partial satisfaction of the borrower’s obligations under the co-op share loan; or
the ﬂip tax is payable when the sales price of the co-op unit exceeds the existing unit owner’s purchase price (based on property appreciation) and then is assessed only on the amount of the appreciation in value (this ﬂip tax is proﬁt-based).
If the ﬂip tax does not meet one of these requirements and is due whether or not the sales price exceeds the existing unit owner’s purchase price, then it may still be eligible as long as the amount of the ﬂip tax is less than or equal to 5% of the value of the property (calculated as the lesser of appraised value or sales price) and it is calculated in one of the following ways:
a ﬂat fee,
a fee per share,
a percentage of the appraised value or sales price of the co-op unit, or
a dollar amount per room.
Co-op Share Loan Documentation
Fannie Mae does not publish multistate standard co-op share loan instruments because of the variations in state laws pertaining to the co-op form of ownership. If a lender elects to use the Fannie Mae ﬁxed-rate note forms for co-op share loans, the lender represents and warrants that the notes comply with all applicable laws and regulations for co-op share loans in and are enforceable and negotiable under the laws of the applicable
Published February 5, 2025
679
jurisdiction.
Fannie Mae publishes state-speciﬁc documentation requirements for states in which Fannie Mae purchases co- op share loans on Fannie Mae's website. Those requirements describe documents that must be delivered to the document custodian (for example, co-op Recognition Agreement, assignments to Fannie Mae, and evidence of share ownership) and documents that the lender must retain in the individual loan ﬁle.
Whole Loan and MBS Delivery Requirements
Co-op share loans may be delivered as whole loans in standard commitments. Co-op share loans pooled in MBS may be eligible for delivery as long as they meet the requirements in
C3-2-01, Determining Eligibility for Loans Pooled into MBS;
C3-5-05, Commingling ARMs in MBS; and
C3-6-01, Parameters for Pooling Loans Into Fannie Majors.

The policies in this topic are applicable to co-op projects located in the ﬁve boroughs of the City of New York and
Published February 5, 2025
680
the New York state counties of Nassau, Rockland, Suﬀolk, and Westchester. These policies provide eligibility ﬂexibilities that address speciﬁc local market conditions and may not be applied to co-op projects outside of these geographic areas.
Special Treatment of Single-Entity Ownership Requirements
The sponsor may own more than 20% of the stock or shares in the corporation and the related occupancy rights provided that any such stock or share ownership above the 20% limitation pertains to units that are subject to statutory rent regulations that limit the sponsor’s ability to sell their ownership interest in such shares or stocks. The lender must obtain documentation to validate that the stock or share is subject to such regulations.
Negative Cash Flow from Unsold Units
Negative cash ﬂow from unsold units is permitted provided all of the following requirements are met:
The co-op corporation’s last audited ﬁnancial statement, current operating budget, and proposed operating budget for the following ﬁscal year, if any, and the New York State Attorney General’s Financial Disclosure Statement (“Attorney General’s Disclosure Statement”) applicable to such co-op project must demonstrate that to the extent that the project has negative cash ﬂow from unsold units
such negative cash ﬂow (including, but not limited to, any principal and interest payments relating to the ﬁnancing obtained by the sponsor to acquire the co-op project) will not exceed an amount equal to 5% of the project’s annual operating budget;
no more than 15% of the co-op unit owners are more than 30 days delinquent in the payment of their ﬁnancial obligations to the co-op corporation; and
if the sponsor fails to pay the monthly assessments relating to all co-op units owned by the sponsor, the monthly assessments of the co-op share owners other than the sponsor will not increase by more than 10%.
The Attorney General’s Disclosure Statement or equivalent sponsor disclosure must also indicate that
the sponsor is current on all ﬁnancial obligations under the oﬀering plan relating to the project;
the sponsor is current on all ﬁnancial obligations relating to any other project in which the sponsor owns or holds more than 10% of the units; and
the sponsor has not pledged any of the shares of the co-op project as security for any loan other than to secure, in whole or in part, the ﬁnancing obtained by the sponsor to acquire the co-op project.
The Attorney General’s Disclosure Statement or equivalent sponsor disclosure must be dated no more than 18 months prior to the share loan note date.
Delivery Requirements
Co-op share loans delivered with the geographic ﬂexibilities described in this topic must be delivered to Fannie Mae with Special Feature Code (SFC) 107 in addition to any other required SFCs.

Fannie Mae publishes on its website the maximum high-cost area loan limits that may apply by state (or territory); however, speciﬁc loan limits are established for each county (or equivalent) and may be lower for each speciﬁc high-cost area. Refer to Loan Limits for Conventional Mortgages for additional information, including the loan limits for each area.
Lenders are responsible for ensuring that the original principal balance of each mortgage loan does not exceed
Published February 5, 2025
682
the applicable maximum loan limit for the speciﬁc area in which the property is located. To assist lenders in determining the applicable limits, Fannie Mae posts reference material on its website, including the Loan Limit Geocoder, which lenders can use to look up loan limits based on a speciﬁc address (or batch of addresses).
Loan Eligibility and Underwriting Requirements
High-balance mortgage loans must meet all standard Fannie Mae eligibility and underwriting requirements, as outlined in this Selling Guide, except as noted in this section. The following guidelines apply to all high-balance mortgage loans:
Loans must be conventional ﬁrst-lien mortgages only.
Loans must meet the LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios as outlined in the Eligibility Matrix.
All borrowers must have a credit score.
All loans must be underwritten through DU.
For additional eligibility information, see the Eligibility Matrix. For information about loan delivery, see B5-1-02, High-Balance Pricing, Mortgage Insurance, Special Feature Codes, and Delivery Limitations.
Note: Unless otherwise notiﬁed by Fannie Mae, existing variances in the Lender Contract apply to high-balance mortgage loans; however, the more restrictive of the eligibility requirements of this section or the lender’s variance will apply.
High LTV Reﬁnance Loans
High-balance mortgage loans are eligible for high LTV reﬁnance options. The eligibility and appraisal requirements speciﬁc to high LTV reﬁnance loans supersede all requirements that apply to high-balance mortgage loans.

Underwriting and DU Requirements Loan Amount Down Payment Requirements Trade Equity from the Borrower’s Existing Manufactured Home Traded Manufactured Homes Purchase Money Transactions Limited Cash-Out Reﬁnance Transactions Cash-Out Reﬁnance Transactions New Construction of a Manufactured Home Construction-to-Permanent Transactions
Underwriting and DU Requirements
Loans secured by manufactured homes (including MH Advantage properties) must be underwritten through DU.
When entering the property information into DU, the lender must correctly identify the property type as a manufactured home or MH Advantage, and identify whether it is in a condo, co-op, or PUD project.
Published February 5, 2025
688
Note: DU does not distinguish between single-width and multi-width.
DU checks the subject property addresses against manufactured home property addresses in the DU property database. If DU’s database indicates the property may be a manufactured home, DU will return a message alerting the lender. DU’s issuance of this message does not necessarily mean the property is a manufactured home, nor does the absence of this message indicate that Fannie Mae accepts the accuracy of the property type as it was submitted
Lenders must research the subject property type. If it is determined the property is a manufactured home, the lender must correct the property type and resubmit the loan caseﬁle to DU. If it is NOT a manufactured home, the loan may be delivered with the appraisal recommendation provided by DU.
Note: DU will issue a message reminding the lender to ensure that the MH Advantage or single-width manufactured home requirements are met, in addition to all other manufactured housing requirements.
Loan Amount
The loan amount may include the following costs:
cost of the manufactured home;
cost of the land;
the costs of construction, including
bona ﬁde and documented transportation costs,
costs for site preparation, which may include the cost to remove an existing manufactured home and other outbuildings,
foundation,
establishing utilities,
all site improvements, and
dwelling installation at the site.
Any personal property items (non-realty items) purchased in conjunction with the manufactured home must be deducted from the sales price and cannot be ﬁnanced as part of the loan.
Down Payment Requirements
A minimum down payment of 5% must come from the borrower’s own funds unless:
the LTV or CLTV ratio is less than or equal to 80%;
the borrower is purchasing a one-unit principal residence and meets the requirements to use gifts, donated grant funds, or funds received from an employer to pay for some or all of the borrower's minimum contribution.

the property meets the MH Advantage requirements and the loan meets the requirements for LTV ratios of 95.01-97%. In this case, the borrower must contribute a minimum down payment of 3%, from their own funds unless the loan meets the gift, grant, or funds from an employer policy referenced above.
The borrower's equity in the land is considered the borrower’s own funds. Where the borrower holds title to the land on which the manufactured home will be permanently attached, the value of the land may be credited toward the borrower’s minimum down payment (or equity requirement for a reﬁnance). The borrower’s equity contribution will be the diﬀerence between any outstanding liens against the land and the market value of the land.
The following table describes how to determine the value of the land based on when and how the borrower acquired the land.

Trade Equity from the Borrower’s Existing Manufactured Home
Trade equity from the borrower’s existing manufactured home may be used as part of the borrower’s minimum down payment requirement. The maximum equity contribution from the traded manufactured home is 90% of the retail value for the traded manufactured home based on the NADA Manufactured Housing Appraisal Guide except:
If the borrower has owned the traded manufactured home for less than 12 months preceding the date of
Published February 5, 2025

the loan application, the maximum equity contribution is the lesser of 90% of the retail value or the lowest price at which the home was sold during that 12 month period.
Any costs associated with the removal of the traded home or any outstanding indebtedness secured by liens on the home must be deducted from the maximum equity contribution.
Traded Manufactured Homes
For traded manufactured homes, Fannie Mae requires a lien search in the appropriate real property and personal property records to verify ownership and to determine whether there are any existing liens on the manufactured home and land, or on the home and the land if they are encumbered by separate liens. The seller of the new manufactured home must provide proof of title transfer and satisfaction of any existing liens on the traded manufactured home.
Purchase Money Transactions
Purchase money transactions are those in which the mortgage proceeds are used to ﬁnance the purchase of the manufactured home or the manufactured home and the land. The land may be previously owned by the borrower, either free of any mortgage or subject to a mortgage that will be paid oﬀ with the proceeds of the new purchase money mortgage.
Note: The borrower does not receive any cash back with a purchase money transaction.
New Manufactured Homes
The LTV ratio (and CLTV/HCLTV ratio, if applicable) for a loan secured by a newly built manufactured home that is being attached to a permanent foundation system in connection with a purchase transaction will be based on the lower of:
the sales price of the manufactured home plus:
the lowest sales price at which the land was sold during that 12 month period if the land was purchased in the 12 months preceding the loan application date; or
the current appraised value of the land if the land was purchased more than 12 months preceding the loan application date.
the “as completed” appraised value of the manufactured home and land.
Existing Manufactured Homes
An existing manufactured home is one that already exists on its foundation.
Manufactured Home Subdivision Development
In cases where a manufactured home is being sold to a consumer by a builder, developer, or manufacturer acting as a developer as part of a new or existing manufactured home subdivision, the LTV ratio (and CLTV/HCLTV ratio, if applicable) for a loan secured by an existing manufactured home will be based on the lower of:
Published February 5, 2025
691
the sales price of the manufactured home and land; or the current appraised value of the manufactured home and land.
All Other Transactions
The LTV ratio (and CLTV/HCLTV ratio, if applicable) for a loan secured by an existing manufactured home will be based on the lowest of:
the sales price of the manufactured home and land;
the current appraised value of the manufactured home and land; or
if the manufactured home was built in the 12 months preceding the loan application date, the lowest price at which the home was previously sold during that 12-month period, plus the lower of:
the current appraised value of the land, or
the lowest price at which the land was sold during that 12-month period (if there was such a sale).
Note: The above purchase requirements do not apply to single-closing construction-to-permanent transactions. See B5-3.1-02, Conversion of Construction-to-Permanent Financing: Single-Closing Transactions for additional information.
Limited Cash-Out Reﬁnance Transactions
Limited cash-out reﬁnance transactions may involve the following scenarios:
payoﬀ of an existing personal property lien on a new manufactured home (or an existing lien on the home and a mortgage on the land if encumbered by separate liens), or
payoﬀ of a ﬁrst lien mortgage secured by an existing manufactured home and land (or existing mortgages for the home and land if encumbered by separate liens).
The maximum LTV ratio (and CLTV ratio, if applicable) for a limited cash-out reﬁnance transaction for a loan secured by a manufactured home and land will be based on the lower of:
the current appraised value of the manufactured home and land; or
if the manufactured home was owned by the borrower for less than 12 months on the loan application date and:
if the home and land are secured by separate liens, the lowest price at which the home was previously sold during that 12-month period plus the lower of the current appraised value of the land, or the lowest sales price at which the land was sold during that 12-month period (if there was such a sale);
if the home and land are secured by a single lien, the lowest price at which the home and land were previously sold during that 12-month period.
Proceeds of a limited cash-out reﬁnance mortgage may be used to:
pay oﬀ the outstanding principal balance of an existing personal property lien or ﬁrst lien mortgage secured by the manufactured home and land (or existing liens if the home and land were encumbered by
Published February 5, 2025
692
separate ﬁrst liens);
pay oﬀ the outstanding principal balance of an existing subordinate mortgage or lien secured by the manufactured home and/or land, but only if it was used to purchase the manufactured home and/or land;
ﬁnance costs of construction;
ﬁnance closing costs (including prepaid expenses); and
provide cash back to the borrower in an amount not to exceed the lesser of 2% of the balance of the new reﬁnance mortgage or $2,000.
Cash-Out Reﬁnance Transactions
A cash-out reﬁnance:
involves the payoﬀ of an existing ﬁrst lien mortgage secured by the manufactured home and land (or existing liens if the home and land were encumbered by separate ﬁrst liens); or
enables the property owner to obtain a mortgage on a property that does not already have a mortgage lien against it, and permits the borrower to take equity out of the property in the form of mortgage proceeds that may be used for any purpose.
To be eligible for a cash-out reﬁnance, the property must be a multi-width manufactured home (single-width are not permitted). The borrower must have owned both the manufactured home and land for at least 12 months preceding the date of the loan application. The LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios will be based on the current appraised value of the manufactured home and land.
New Construction of a Manufactured Home
When the mortgage loan funds the construction of a new manufactured home, construction must be complete when the loan is purchased (or securitized) by Fannie Mae. As a reminder, if construction is completed after the ﬁrst payment date of the subject loan, the loan may be subject to the property value requirements (loans more than four months old at time of purchase) or seasoned loan requirements in B2-1.5-02, Loan Eligibility.
Construction-to-Permanent Transactions
The following construction-to-permanent transactions are permitted for the construction and permanent ﬁnancing of a manufactured home:
single-closing transactions processed as a purchase or limited cash-out reﬁnance, and
two-closing limited cash-out reﬁnances. (Two-closing cash-out reﬁnances are not permitted.)
The loan must meet the requirements in Section B5-3.1, Conversion of Construction-to-Permanent Financing, and all other manufactured home requirements in this Guide.

Closing Instructions Post Closing Items and Conversion to Real Property Certiﬁcate of Title Title Issues and Lien Requirements Title Insurance Loan Documents The Security Instrument Aﬃdavit of Aﬃxture Background Information Regarding Titling for Manufactured Homes Background Information on States where Surrender of a Certiﬁcate of Title is not Permitted
Closing Instructions
Published February 5, 2025
695
Closing instructions must advise closing agents to obtain the required documentation necessary to ensure that the manufactured home is attached to a permanent foundation system on the land, thus becoming part of the real property.
If a closing agent is not available to perform this action, the lender can rely on the certiﬁcation of completion completed by the appraiser.
In addition, where state law provides that a manufactured home may be exempt from certiﬁcate of title requirements (for instance, where a home is attached initially to a permanent foundation system), such closing instructions must instruct the closing agent to ensure that the manufactured home qualiﬁes for exemption from certiﬁcate of title requirements, including monitoring of property installation procedures and the related documentation, and to provide the lender with documentary evidence of that for retention in the loan ﬁle.
Where state law allows for the elimination of the certiﬁcate of title, the closing instructions must instruct the closing agent to perform all necessary procedures to:
assure that the certiﬁcate of title to the manufactured home is properly retired, and
provide the lender with documentary evidence for retention in the loan ﬁle.
Post Closing Items and Conversion to Real Property
If there are post closing items related to conversion of the manufactured home from personal property to real property, the lender should consider use of a properly circumscribed power of attorney from the borrower that may be used to complete the post closing items. All post closing items must be documented in the loan ﬁle and, any relevant documents received after closing must be included in the loan ﬁle.

must sign both, each using the exact same name
on both documents).
Note: Given certain provisions of Mississippi law and the practice in the state, the requirements in the last row of the above table apply to manufactured homes in Mississippi. (The other two options in this table do not apply.)
Title Issues and Lien Requirements
To be eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae:
A manufactured home loan must be secured by a perfected lien (or liens) on real property consisting of the manufactured home and the borrower's interest in the land.
Published February 5, 2025
697
The manufactured home must be legally classiﬁed as real property under applicable state law, including relevant statutes, regulations, and judicial decisions.
To assist lenders in originating manufactured home loans in various states, Fannie Mae publishes information on titling manufactured homes as real property. Note, this information does not constitute legal advice; lenders must consult their own legal counsel. See Titling Manufactured Housing.
The following requirements are also applicable:
The owner of the manufactured home must own the land on which the home is situated unless the manufactured home is located in a condo or PUD project subject to a ground lease approved by Fannie Mae's Project Review Eligibility Service (PERS).
The manufactured home must be attached to a permanent foundation on the land and comply with state and jurisdictional requirements for permanent aﬃxation.
A mortgage, deed of trust, or security deed must be recorded in the land records and must identify the encumbered property as including both the home and the borrower's interest in the land.
If applicable state law so permits, any certiﬁcate of title to the manufactured home must be surrendered to the appropriate state government authority.
If the certiﬁcate of title cannot be surrendered, the lender must indicate its lien on the certiﬁcate.
Fannie Mae prefers that a loan on the manufactured home and the land on which it is situated be secured by a single lien.
However, it is recognized that some state laws do not provide for a single lien on both the manufactured home and the land. Therefore, a loan documented by a lien on the borrower's interest in the land evidenced by a mortgage, deed of trust or security deed and by a real property lien on the manufactured home evidenced on the certiﬁcate of title or other document is acceptable.
Note: Loans in which there is a chattel lien on the home plus a real property lien on the land are unacceptable.
Title Insurance
The mortgage must be covered under a standard real property title insurance policy that insures that the manufactured home is part of the real property that secures the loan.
American Land Title Association® (ALTA®) Endorsement 7, 7.1, or 7.2 or any other endorsement required in the applicable jurisdiction for manufactured homes to be treated as real property must be included in the ﬁle.
Loan Documents
Fannie Mae prefers lenders to use the standard Fannie Mae Uniform Instruments (see Security Instruments).
If the Uniform Instruments are not used, then the lender must adhere to the following requirements:
A single note must be used evidencing all the debt related to the land and the home, and a mortgage,
Published February 5, 2025
698
deed of trust, or Georgia security deed securing such indebtedness (plus the certiﬁcate of title if state law so requires).
The note used must provide the nonstandard document warranties that are referenced in A2-2-03, Document Warranties.
Loan documents are not acceptable if they:
state that the home is personal property or contain other words to that eﬀect;
state that the parties do not intend to attach the home to a permanent foundation system on the land, or contain statements inconsistent with that intention;
unless required by law, provide that rights of holders in due course are waived, or with other words provide that an assignee note holder may be held liable for claims the borrower may have against other parties; or
include consumer ﬁnance paper which combines the note and security instrument in a single document or a retail installment sales contract.
The Security Instrument
The security instrument must:
state that the manufactured home is an improvement to the land and an immovable ﬁxture, or include similar language as may be required by applicable law to assure, to the greatest extent possible, that the manufactured home will be treated as real property under applicable state law. If applicable law provides speciﬁc obligatory wording, such wording must be used; and
include a comprehensive description of the manufactured home and the land in the property description section.
The description must include the serial or VIN number (or the serial number or VIN for each unit if the home is multi-width), make, model, size, and any other information that may be required by applicable law to deﬁnitively identify the home.
Note: The serial number is located on the HUD Data Plate located on the interior of the home, usually near the electrical box. In addition, the serial number is generally cold-stamped on the frame front cross member of each transportable section.
Some jurisdictions may not allow any information in the property description section of the security instrument other than what is customary for other real property transactions. If this is the case, then an addendum may be used, which must be attached to the security instrument and included in the loan ﬁle.
Aﬃdavit of Aﬃxture
The borrower(s) must sign an Aﬃdavit of Aﬃxture (which must be in the form prescribed by applicable law, if any) that acknowledges their intent for the manufactured home to be permanently part of the real property that secures the mortgage free of any personal property security interest. If the manufactured home was previously converted from personal property to real property in accordance with applicable law, the Aﬃdavit is not required by Fannie Mae unless applicable law requires a new Aﬃdavit. Where applicable law does not require an
Published February 5, 2025
699
Aﬃdavit to be recorded, it is preferable that an Aﬃdavit be recorded.
Note: If state law requires a Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) ﬁling in order to perfect a security interest in a manufactured home, the lender must make such ﬁling in any and all appropriate locations.
Background Information Regarding Titling for Manufactured Homes
Titling is complex and further complicated by the lack of a federal standard. Consequently, all states devise their own laws resulting in diverse approaches to manufactured home titling and lien perfection. The variety of approaches is particularly challenging for lenders originating manufactured home loans in more than one state. Laws of some states do not clearly provide for a single lien on the manufactured home, together with the land on which it is situated, but instead, for example, require that the lien on the manufactured home be evidenced by notation on the certiﬁcate of title.
While the laws of some states establish a procedure for surrender of the certiﬁcate of title when the manufactured home has become so permanently aﬃxed to the land that it has become real property, the laws of other states do not allow for the elimination of the certiﬁcate of title to a manufactured home regardless of the degree of aﬃxation of the home to the land. In these states, the lien on the land (evidenced by the mortgage, deed of trust or security deed) may be legally distinct from the lien on the manufactured home (evidenced on the certiﬁcate of title), though both are liens on real property. In this instance, the manufactured home is often treated as an “immovable ﬁxture” (personal property that has become so permanently attached to the land that it has become real property).
Research on state laws aﬀecting manufactured housing liens indicates, more speciﬁcally, that in order to document a lien on a manufactured home that is real property, state laws take several approaches:
surrendering the certiﬁcate of title when the manufactured home is permanently aﬃxed to the land;
statutory, regulatory, or judicial authority for recognizing a manufactured home as part of the real property, without surrender of the certiﬁcate of title. A few states also require UCC ﬁlings; or
recognizing the manufactured home as real property without issuing a certiﬁcate of title when the unit is aﬃxed to the land.
Most states permitting manufactured homes to be treated as real property without ﬁrst being titled as personal property also have procedures for issuing a certiﬁcate of title and then surrendering it.
Background Information on States where Surrender of a Certiﬁcate of Title is not Permitted
State law that does not provide for surrender of the certiﬁcate of title may pose some additional risk to the lender and Fannie Mae.
Under the UCC, as adopted in almost every state, a lien evidenced on any outstanding certiﬁcate of title will have priority over a lien on real property to which the manufactured home is aﬃxed, which is evidenced by a mortgage, deed of trust, or security deed.
However, Fannie Mae believes that if a lender follows procedures tailored to take advantage of all protection oﬀered under existing state law—including taking steps to assure that no certiﬁcate of title still exists that bears

evidence of any lien securing any other loan—suﬃcient legal protection is aﬀorded.

Conversion of Construction-to-Permanent Financing Overview
The conversion of construction-to-permanent ﬁnancing involves the granting of a long-term mortgage to a borrower for the purpose of replacing interim construction ﬁnancing that the borrower has obtained to fund the construction of a new residence.
Construction-to-permanent ﬁnancing can be structured as a transaction with one closing or a transaction with two separate closings. The borrower must hold title to the lot, which may have been previously acquired or be purchased as part of the transaction.
All construction work, including any work that could entitle a party to ﬁle a mechanic's or materialmen’s lien, must be completed and paid for, and all mechanic's liens, materialmen’s liens, and any other liens and claims that could become liens relating to the construction must be satisﬁed before the mortgage loan is delivered to Fannie Mae. The lender must retain in its individual loan ﬁle a Form 1004D or a completion alternative of the completed property. When a construction-to-permanent mortgage loan provides funds for acquisition or reﬁnancing of an unimproved lot and the construction of a residence on the lot, the lender must retain a certiﬁcate of occupancy or an equivalent form from the applicable government authority.
The lender must use Fannie Mae's uniform mortgage instruments to document the permanent mortgage. These documents may not be altered to include any reference to construction of the property, other than any alteration that Fannie Mae speciﬁcally requires.
Attached units in a condo project and all co-op properties are ineligible for construction-to-permanent ﬁnancing. Detached units in condo projects are permitted for construction-to-permanent ﬁnancing, including manufactured homes in a condo project (subject to applicable project review requirements).
For guidance on data entry for construction-to-permanent transactions in DU, see the related Desktop Underwriter Job Aid.

Introduction This topic contains information on construction-to-permanent ﬁnancing loan eligibility for single-closing transactions, including:
Single-Closing Transaction Overview Terms of Construction Loan Period for Single-Closing Construction-to-Permanent Mortgages Eligible Loan Purposes for Single-Closing Construction-to-Permanent Mortgages Calculating the LTV Ratio for Single-Closing Construction-to-Permanent Mortgages Down Payment Requirements for Single-Closing Purchase Transactions Modiﬁcations of Single-Closing Construction-to-Permanent Mortgages Underwriting Single-Closing Construction-to-Permanent Mortgages Age of Credit Documents Age of Appraisal Documents Requaliﬁcation Requirements Loan Conversion Documentation Options
Single-Closing Transaction Overview
Single-closing transactions may be used for both the construction loan and the permanent ﬁnancing if the borrower wants to close on both the construction loan and the permanent ﬁnancing at the same time. When a single-closing transaction is used, the lender will be responsible for managing the disbursement of the loan proceeds to the builder, contractor, or other authorized suppliers.
Because the loan documents specify the terms of the permanent ﬁnancing, the construction loan will automatically convert to a permanent long-term mortgage loan upon completion of the construction.
Loans that combine construction and permanent ﬁnancing into a single transaction cannot be purchased by Fannie Mae until the construction is completed and the terms of the construction loan have converted to the permanent ﬁnancing.
Manufactured homes must meet all applicable requirements, including compliance with B5-2-05, Manufactured Housing Legal Considerations.
Lenders must use SFC 151 when delivering single-closing construction-to-permanent loans to Fannie Mae (and any other SFCs that may apply to the transaction).
Terms of Construction Loan Period for Single-Closing Construction-to-Permanent Mortgages
For all single-closing construction-to-permanent transactions, the construction loan must be structured as a temporary loan exempt from the ability to repay requirements under Regulation Z. The construction loan period
Published February 5, 2025
703
for single-closing construction-to-permanent transactions may have no single period of more than 12 months and the total period may not exceed 18 months. Lenders may, when needed to complete the construction, provide an extension to the original period to total no more than 18 months but the documents may not indicate an initial construction period or subsequent extension of more than 12 months. After conversion to permanent ﬁnancing, the loan must have a loan term not exceeding 30 years (disregarding the construction period).
As examples, lenders may structure the construction loan period as follows:
three 6–month periods,
one 12–month period and one 6–month period, or
six 3–month periods.
Exceptions to the 12-month and 18-month periods will not be granted. The above construction period requirements do not apply to two-closing construction-to-permanent transactions. If the construction loan period exceeds the requirements above, the lender must process the loan as a two-closing construction-to-permanent transaction in order for the loan to be eligible for sale to Fannie Mae (see B5-3.1-03, Conversion of Construction-to-Permanent Financing: Two-Closing Transactions).
Eligible Loan Purposes for Single-Closing Construction-to-Permanent Mortgages
A single-closing construction-to-permanent mortgage loan may be closed as:
a purchase transaction, or
a limited cash-out reﬁnance transaction.
When a purchase transaction is used, the borrower is not the owner of the lot at the time of the ﬁrst advance of interim construction ﬁnancing, and the borrower is using the proceeds from the interim construction ﬁnancing to purchase the lot and ﬁnance the construction of the property.
When a limited cash-out reﬁnance transaction is used, the borrower must have held legal title to the lot before they receive the ﬁrst advance of interim construction ﬁnancing. The borrower is using the proceeds from the construction ﬁnancing to pay oﬀ any existing liens on the lot and ﬁnance the construction of the property. This type of transaction is not a “true” limited cash-out reﬁnance whereby the borrower reﬁnances a loan(s) that was used to purchase a completed property; however, all other requirements for limited cash-out reﬁnances apply. See B2-1.3-02, Limited Cash-Out Reﬁnance Transactions and the limited cash-out reﬁnance requirements in B5-2-03, Manufactured Housing Underwriting Requirements.
Note: Cash-out reﬁnance transactions are not eligible for single-closing construction-to-permanent mortgages.
Calculating the LTV Ratio for Single-Closing Construction-to-Permanent Mortgages
Single-closing construction-to-permanent mortgages are subject to the purchase and limited cash-out reﬁnance maximum LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios (based on property type) provided in the Eligibility Matrix , as applicable.
Published February 5, 2025

Down Payment Requirements for Single-Closing Purchase Transactions
The borrower must use their own funds to make the minimum borrower contribution unless:
the LTV, CLTV, or HCLTV ratio is less than or equal to 80%; or
the borrower is purchasing a one-unit principal residence and meets the requirements to use gifts, donated grant funds, or funds received from an employer to pay for some or all of the borrower's minimum contribution. See B3-4.3-04, Personal Gifts; B3-4.3-06, Grants and Lender Contributions; and B3-4.3-08, Employer Assistance, for additional information.
Modiﬁcations of Single-Closing Construction-to-Permanent Mortgages
If the terms of the permanent ﬁnancing change after the original closing date of the construction loan, the loan may be modiﬁed to reﬂect the new terms if it meets all of the following criteria:
The modiﬁcation must take place prior to or at the time of conversion.
Only the following loan terms may be modiﬁed in a single-closing transaction:

The loan must be underwritten based on the terms of the loan as modiﬁed and delivered to Fannie Mae. If the ﬁnal (modiﬁed) terms of the loan do not match the last submission to DU, the loan must be resubmitted to DU (subject to Underwriting Single-Closing Construction-to-Permanent Mortgages and Requaliﬁcation Requirements described below).
Increases to the loan amount are permitted only as necessary to cover documented increased costs of construction of the property.
If the modiﬁcation results in an increase in the original loan amount, the lender remains responsible for all standard title insurance requirements. In addition, the lender must obtain an endorsement to the title insurance policy that
extends the eﬀective date of the coverage to the date of the recording of the modiﬁcation agreement;
increases the amount of the policy to the original loan amount, as increased; and
conﬁrms that the lien of the mortgage, as modiﬁed, continues to be a ﬁrst lien.
Note: Both the original construction loan amount at closing and the ﬁnal modiﬁed loan amount delivered to Fannie Mae must meet the loan limits currently in eﬀect.
The original construction loan must be documented on Fannie Mae uniform instruments or substantially similar documents, subject to the non-standard document representations and warranties.
The modiﬁcation must be documented on one of the following:
Loan Modiﬁcation Agreement (Providing for Fixed Interest Rate) (Fannie Mae Form 3179);
Loan Modiﬁcation Agreement (Providing for Adjustable Interest Rate) (Fannie Mae Form 3161); or
A substantially similar document, subject to the non-standard document representations and warranties.
Underwriting Single-Closing Construction-to-Permanent Mortgages
The lender must underwrite a single-closing construction-to-permanent loan based on the terms of the permanent ﬁnancing. If the permanent ﬁnancing terms are modiﬁed, and no longer reﬂect the terms on which the underwriting was based, the loan must be re-underwritten, subject to certain re-underwriting tolerances. The loan data at delivery must match the data in the ﬁnal submission of the loan caseﬁle to DU.
As described in the table below, re-underwriting tolerances may be applied if the interest rate or loan amount was modiﬁed. (All other modiﬁcations require re-underwriting.)

Modiﬁed Loan Term
Re-underwriting Tolerances
For loans underwritten through DU: see the tolerances and resubmission
requirements in B3-2-10, Accuracy of DU Data, DU Tolerances, and Errors in
Interest Rate
the Credit Report.
For manually underwritten loans: if the recalculated DTI (based on the
change in rate or loan amount) does not exceed 45%, the loan must be re-
underwritten with the updated information to determine if the loan is still
eligible for delivery.
Loan Amount
Note: If the increase in the DTI ratio moves the DTI ratio above the 36%
threshold, the loan must meet the credit score and reserve requirements in
the Eligibility Matrix that apply to DTI ratios greater than 36% up to 45%.
Age of Credit Documents
All credit documents must be no more than four months old on the note date (that is, the closing date of the construction loan). Additionally, income, employment, and credit report documents must be no more than four months old at the time of conversion to permanent ﬁnancing. As an exception, these documents may be more than four months but not exceeding 12 months old at the time of the conversion to permanent ﬁnancing if all of the following conditions were met at the time of the original closing of the construction loan:
The LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios do not exceed 95%.
The representative credit score of the loan is greater than or equal to 700.
The loan caseﬁle was underwritten through DU and received an Approve/Eligible recommendation.
If any one of the above conditions was not met or an eligible loan term was modiﬁed subsequent to the last DU submission, the lender must
obtain updated income, employment, and credit report documents no more than four months prior to conversion; and
re-qualify the borrower(s) in accordance with the Requaliﬁcation Requirements below.
Updated asset documentation is not required at the time of conversion to permanent ﬁnancing (regardless of the age of asset documents) unless upon requaliﬁcation, either of the following applies:
more reserves are required than were required at the time of original qualiﬁcation
the full amount of reserves must then be reveriﬁed, or
the borrower chooses to bring additional funds to the transaction
the additional funds must come from an eligible source and be documented.
Impact on Validation through the DU Validation Service
If updated credit documents are required to be obtained after the original closing of the construction loan, any validation of income, employment, or assets is no longer applicable. Updated validation reports must be obtained, and the loan caseﬁle resubmitted to DU, and the loan must convert to permanent ﬁnancing by the
Published February 5, 2025
707
Close By Date stated in the DU validation message in order for validation and the associated waiver of enforcement relief of representations and warranties to apply.
See B1-1-03, Allowable Age of Credit Documents and Federal Income Tax Returns for additional information.
Age of Appraisal Documents
For all single-closing transactions, the eﬀective date of the appraisal must be no more than four months prior to the note date (that is, the closing date of the construction loan). Additionally, at the time of completion of construction, an Appraisal Update and/or Completion Report ( Form 1004D ) must be completed in its entirety including the appraisal update and certiﬁcation of completion. If the appraiser indicates on the Form 1004d that the property value has declined, then the lender must obtain a new appraisal for the property and requalify the borrower using the updated LTV ratio per the Requaliﬁcation Requirements, below.
See B4-1.2-04, Appraisal Age and Use Requirements for additional information.
Requaliﬁcation Requirements
Requaliﬁcation of the borrower(s) is required at the time of conversion to permanent ﬁnancing if
the LTV ratio increased due to a decline in property value, updated credit documents were obtained, or as otherwise required per the modiﬁed loan term in the table above.
To be eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae, the loan must retain an Approve/Eligible recommendation after resubmission to DU (or, be eligible per the Eligibility Matrix if manually underwritten).
When requaliﬁcation is required
the LTV ratio must be adjusted based on the updated appraisal, if applicable; if credit documents exceed the four (or 12) month age of documentation requirement, the updated income, credit, and liability information must be considered; and the loan data at delivery must match the data considered in the ﬁnal requaliﬁcation of the loan.
Loan Conversion Documentation Options
The construction loan may be converted into a permanent loan in either of the following ways:
Option 1: A construction loan rider must be used to modify Fannie Mae’s uniform instrument that will be used for the permanent loan. The rider must state the construction loan terms, and the construction- related provisions of the rider must become null and void at the end of the construction period and before the permanent loan is sold to Fannie Mae. Because the permanent loan cannot be sold before it is scheduled to begin amortizing, the lender will need to amend the construction loan rider, and the accompanying uniform instrument, if the construction is completed sooner or later than originally anticipated. The amendment(s) should provide the new dates on which amortization for the permanent loan will begin and end. The lender also will need to record the amended documents before the permanent loan is sold.
Published February 5, 2025
708
Option 2: A separate modiﬁcation agreement must be used to convert the construction loan into permanent ﬁnancing. This agreement must be executed and recorded in the applicable jurisdiction before the permanent loan is sold to Fannie Mae.
The lender must include the applicable conversion document in its loan submission package. When amended documents are recorded in connection with a construction loan rider, the lender also must include a copy of the original documentation that the borrower signed.

Two-Closing Transactions Overview Eligible Loan Purposes for Two-Closing Construction-to-Permanent Mortgages
Two-Closing Transactions Overview
Two-closing construction-to-permanent mortgage transactions utilize two separate loan closings with two separate sets of legal documents. A modiﬁcation may not be used to update the original note, rather a new note must be completed and signed by the borrower(s). The ﬁrst closing is to obtain the interim construction ﬁnancing (and may include the purchase of the lot), and the second closing is to obtain the permanent ﬁnancing upon completion of the improvements. Fannie Mae does not purchase construction loans (the ﬁrst closing); however, Fannie Mae does purchase loans that were used to provide the permanent ﬁnancing.
Published February 5, 2025
709
The lender that provides the permanent long-term mortgage may be a diﬀerent lender than the one that provided the interim ﬁnancing. The lender must underwrite the borrower based on the terms of the permanent mortgage.
Eligible Loan Purposes for Two-Closing Construction-to-Permanent Mortgages
In a two-closing construction-to-permanent transaction, the permanent mortgage delivered to Fannie Mae may be closed as:
a limited cash-out reﬁnance transaction, or
a cash-out reﬁnance transaction.
Two-closing construction-to-permanent mortgages are subject to the limited cash-out and cash-out reﬁnance maximum LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios based on the property type provided in the Eligibility Matrix , as applicable. For the borrower to be eligible for a cash-out reﬁnance transaction, the borrower must have held legal title to the lot for at least six months prior to the closing of the permanent mortgage. All other standard cash-out reﬁnance eligibility and underwriting requirements apply.
Note: Two-closing cash-out reﬁnances are not permitted on a manufactured home.

Overview Allowable Improvements

Lender Eligibility Lender Responsibilities Delivery and Recourse Requirements Removal of Recourse
Overview
The HomeStyle Renovation mortgage enables a borrower to purchase a property or reﬁnance an existing loan and include funds in the loan amount to cover the costs of repairs, remodeling, renovations, or energy improvements to the property. The loan may be delivered to Fannie Mae prior to completion of the renovation, subject to limited recourse as described below.
Note: For loan caseﬁles underwritten through DU, DU will determine that the transaction is a HomeStyle Renovation loan if the Renovation indicator in Property and Loan Information (L1) is selected and there is an amount entered in Line B (L4) of the online loan application.
Allowable Improvements
There are no required improvements or restrictions on the types of renovations allowed, nor is there a minimum dollar amount for renovations.
Generally, improvements should be permanently aﬃxed to the real property (either dwelling or land), with the exception of certain appliances installed with kitchen and utility room remodels. The borrower may use HomeStyle Renovation to purchase appliances as part of an overall remodeling project that includes substantial changes or upgrades to the rooms in which the appliances are placed.
HomeStyle Renovation may be used to complete the ﬁnal work on a newly built home when the home is at least 90% complete. The remaining improvements must be related to completing non-structural items the original builder was unable to ﬁnish. Such work may include installation of buyer-selected items such as ﬂooring, cabinets, kitchen appliances, ﬁxtures, and trim.
HomeStyle Renovation may be used to construct various outdoor buildings and structures when allowed by local zoning regulations. These buildings or structures must be in compliance with any applicable building codes for the local area. Examples of acceptable structures include, but are not limited to, accessory units, garages, recreation rooms, and swimming pools. See Accessory Dwelling Units in B2-3-04, Special Property Eligibility Considerations for additional information about eligible ADUs.
HomeStyle Renovation may not be used for complete tear-down and reconstruction of the dwelling.
HomeStyle Renovation may also be used to ﬁnance energy-related improvements. See B5-3.3-01, HomeStyle Energy for Improvements on Existing Properties, for additional information.
Lender Eligibility
HomeStyle Renovation mortgage loans have speciﬁc product requirements and guidelines for which lenders must ensure detailed compliance. Lenders must obtain special approval to deliver these types of loans to Fannie

711
Mae prior to completion of the renovation work. See A2-1-01, Contractual Obligations for Sellers/Servicers for additional information. If a lender delivers HomeStyle Renovation loans to Fannie Mae after all renovation work is complete, no special approval is required.
Lender Responsibilities
Renovation work must be completed no later than 15 months from date the loan is closed. In the rare circumstance a renovation project exceeds 15 months, the lender must submit this information to Loan Quality Connect to describe the circumstances resulting in the delay and determine potential remedies. These options may include
a limited extension of the timeframe (not to exceed 18 months from the date the loan was closed),
curtailment of the work to be completed,
repurchase of the loan, or
other remedies applicable to the speciﬁc circumstance.
Fannie Mae has sole discretion in determining which remedy is acceptable when renovation timeframe exceeds 15 months.
Lenders may not transfer servicing on HomeStyle Renovation loans during the renovation period.
The lender is responsible for monitoring completion of the renovation work and must exercise all approval and oversight responsibilities that are customary and required to comply with speciﬁc state laws and to ensure that clear title to the property is maintained.
Lenders may use vendors to manage the operational, escrow, and completion requirements for HomeStyle Renovation loans; but when a vendor is used, the lender is responsible for adequate vendor oversight to ensure all requirements are met.
If any action the lender takes or fails to take in overseeing the renovation work aﬀects Fannie Mae’s ability to acquire clear title to the property, the lender may be required to repurchase the loan.
The lender must maintain a copy of all of the documentation that supports the renovation work, including plans and speciﬁcations, “as completed” appraisal, renovation contract, renovation loan agreement, certiﬁcate of completion, title insurance endorsements or updates, and any other related documentation in the loan ﬁle. For more information about the specialized legal documentation Fannie Mae requires for a HomeStyle Renovation mortgage, see Subpart B8, Closing: Legal Documents.
Delivery and Recourse Requirements
A lender may deliver a HomeStyle Renovation loan as soon as it is closed; the renovation does not need to have been completed when the loan is delivered as long as the lender delivers that loan with recourse. If the borrower defaults under the terms of the loan before the work is completed, and that default continues for at least 120 days, the lender may be required to repurchase the loan. One of the following SFCs is required when the loan is delivered.

Note: The HomeStyle Energy SFCs are required in addition to the applicable HomeStyle Renovation SFC.
Removal of Recourse
For loans delivered with recourse, the lender may request the recourse obligation be removed when the renovation is complete. The following criteria will be applicable to the removal of recourse:
Recourse will not be removed if the loan is delinquent when the lender requests removal.
If the borrower was 1 x 30 days delinquent at any point during the renovation work, but is current when removal is requested, the recourse may be removed.
If the borrower had more than one 30 day delinquency or was ever 60 - 90 days delinquent, the lender may request recourse removal after the borrower has made 36 payments with no delinquencies.
To request removal of recourse, the lender must submit a complete Appraisal Update and/or Completion Report
Published February 5, 2025
713
( Form 1004D) to Loan Quality Connect. Submissions must meet the following requirements:
The Fannie Mae loan number(s) must be identiﬁed in the request and attached documents must have the loan numbers in the title.
Documents must be clear and complete. For example, it is a best practice to include photos of completed renovations with all submissions.
See B5-3.2-05, HomeStyle Renovation Mortgages: Completion Certiﬁcation, for additional information.
HomeStyle Renovation mortgages are eligible for enforcement relief of underwriting and eligibility representations and warranties as described in A2-3.2-02, Enforcement Relief for Breaches of Certain Representations and Warranties Related to Underwriting and Eligibility. To be eligible for relief, the renovation must be complete and recourse removed.

Borrower Requirements
Renovation-Related Costs
Renovation-related costs that may be considered as part of the total renovation costs include:
property inspection fees;
costs and fees for the title update;
architectural and engineering fees;
independent consultant fees;
costs for required permits;
other documented charges, such as fees for energy reports, appraisals, review of renovation plans, and fees charged for processing renovation draws; and
up to six months payments (PITIA) if a principal residence property cannot be occupied during renovation (see B5-3.2-04, HomeStyle Renovation Mortgages: Costs and Escrow Accounts for additional information).
Note: An amount for sweat equity may not be factored into the renovation costs.
Property Requirements
The security property for a HomeStyle Renovation mortgage must be
a one- to four-unit principal residence;
a one-unit second home;
a one-unit investment property;
a manufactured home; or
a unit in an eligible PUD, condo, or co-op project.
When the security property is a unit in a condo or co-op project, the proposed renovation work must be permissible under the bylaws of the HOA or co-op corporation, or the HOA or co-op corporation must have given written approval for the renovation work. The renovation work for a condo or co-op unit must be limited to the interior of the unit, including the installation of ﬁre walls in the attic.
The renovation of manufactured homes is allowed under HomeStyle Renovation provided the improvements do not include structural changes (such as adding a garage or other attached element). Eligible, non-structural improvements include, but are not limited to
improvements to kitchens and bathrooms;
installing energy eﬃciency heating and cooling systems;
changes to address mobility and aging in place requirements; and
Published February 5, 2025
715
installation of new windows, doors, siding, or rooﬁng provided these changes do not alter the structure of the unit.
HomeReady Eligibility
HomeReady loans are eligible in combination with HomeStyle Renovation; however, the more restrictive requirements of HomeReady or HomeStyle Renovation apply when these two products are combined on a loan. For example, a HomeReady HomeStyle Renovation mortgage must be a principal residence transaction, whereas standard HomeStyle Renovation permits second homes and investment properties.
Exceptions:
For purchase transactions with LTV, CLTV, or HCLTV ratios 95.01 - 97% that combine HomeReady and HomeStyle Renovation, Fannie Mae is not requiring at least one borrower to be a ﬁrst-time homebuyer.
The mortgage insurance requirements for HomeReady apply when HomeReady and HomeStyle Renovation are combined. See B7-1-02, Mortgage Insurance Coverage Requirements, for details.
Mortgage Terms
A HomeStyle Renovation mortgage may be either a ﬁxed-rate mortgage or an ARM loan. The original principal amount of the mortgage may not exceed Fannie Mae’s maximum allowable mortgage amount for a conventional ﬁrst mortgage.
Fannie Mae provides the HomeStyle Renovation Maximum Mortgage Worksheet (Form 1035), to assist lenders in calculating the maximum loan amount.
The maximum cost for renovations for various HomeStyle Renovation scenarios are described in the following table.
Transaction Type
The cost of renovations must not exceed...
75% of the lesser of
Purchase transaction
the sum of the purchase price of the property plus
renovation costs, or
the “as completed” appraised value of the property.
Reﬁnance transaction
75% of the “as completed” appraised value of the
property.
the lesser of
Manufactured homes
$50,000 or
50% of the “as completed” appraised value.
Published February 5, 2025
716
“Do It Yourself” Option
The “Do It Yourself” option is available for renovations made to one-unit properties by the borrower. This option is not available for manufactured homes. “Do It Yourself” renovations may not represent more than 10% of the “as completed” value of the property. The lender must review and approve the renovations in advance, and must inspect the completion of all items that cost more than $5,000.
A borrower may request reimbursement for their payments for the cost of materials or for the cost of properly documented contract labor, but not for the cost of their sweat equity (labor). When a borrower chooses this option, the lender must fully budget for the cost of labor and materials related to the renovation so that, should the borrower be unable to complete the work, a contractor can be hired to ﬁnish any of the “Do It Yourself” repairs.
LTV Ratios
All of the applicable LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios for HomeStyle Renovation mortgages can be found in the Eligibility Matrix .
The LTV ratio calculation diﬀers based on the applicable transaction type.
For a purchase money transaction, the LTV ratio is determined by dividing the original loan amount by the lesser of the “as completed” appraised value of the property or the sum of the purchase price of the property and the total renovation costs.
For a reﬁnance transaction, the LTV ratio is determined by dividing the original loan amount by the “as completed” appraised value of the property.
Limited Cash-out Transactions
When a HomeStyle Renovation mortgage loan is originated as a limited cash-out reﬁnance transaction, the loan amount may include
the amount required to satisfy the existing ﬁrst mortgage;
the amount required to satisfy any outstanding subordinate mortgage liens that were used to acquire the property;
closing costs, prepaid fees, and points; and
the total renovation costs, including allowable renovation-related costs for the home improvements up to the maximum permitted LTV and CLTV ratios.
The borrower may not obtain any other funds from the transaction, including those that are generally allowed for a limited cash-out reﬁnance transaction. Excess funds, if any, after renovations are completed, may be applied to the loan balance as a curtailment or may be reimbursed to the borrower for the cost of actual supplies or additional renovations for which paid receipts are provided. The value of sweat equity may not be

reimbursed.
Borrower Requirements
Borrowers must meet the requirements of B2-2-01, General Borrower Eligibility Requirements. Nonproﬁt investors and local government agencies may be considered for eligibility on a negotiated basis. Lenders may contact their Fannie Mae customer account team for more information.
To ensure that the borrower understands all of the terms of a HomeStyle Renovation mortgage, the lender may use Fannie Mae’s HomeStyle Renovation Consumer Tips (Form 1204), as a checklist for the key facts that need to be disclosed to the borrower, and the borrower’s signature will serve as an acknowledgment of their understanding of these facts.

Appraisal Requirements
The appraisal report for a HomeStyle Renovation mortgage must provide an “as completed” appraised value that estimates the value of the property after completion of the renovation work. (See B5-3.2-02, HomeStyle Renovation Mortgages: Loan and Borrower Eligibility, for requirements pertaining to the cost of the renovations as a percentage of the appraised value. See also Unplanned Changes in Scope or Incomplete Work later in this topic.
Published February 5, 2025
718
Energy Report Requirements
The lender must review an energy report if a HomeStyle Renovation loan is being combined with a HomeStyle Energy loan. See B5-3.3-01, HomeStyle Energy for Improvements on Existing Properties, for additional information concerning the requirements related to the energy report.
Note: Energy improvements may be ﬁnanced without obtaining an energy report if the lender is not utilizing the additional ﬂexibilities under the HomeStyle Energy program.
Contractor Requirements
All renovation work must be performed by a licensed contractor or subcontractor, unless contractor licensing is not applicable under state or local law for the speciﬁc trade or type of renovations being performed.
The borrower must choose the contractor to perform the needed renovation, subject to the lender’s determination that the contractor is
qualiﬁed and experienced,
has all appropriate credentials required by the state,
is ﬁnancially able to perform the duties necessary to complete the renovation work in a timely manner, and
agrees to indemnify the borrower for all property losses or damages caused by its employees or subcontractors
The lender may not choose the contractor or refer the borrower to any one speciﬁc contractor. However, the lender may require the borrower to obtain a completed Contractor Proﬁle Report (Form 1202) from the contractor that is selected to ensure that the lender has suﬃcient information available to make a determination about the contractor’s qualiﬁcations.
The borrower may also complete repairs under the “Do It Yourself” option described in B5-3.2-02, HomeStyle Renovation Mortgages: Loan and Borrower Eligibility.
Plans and Speciﬁcations
The plans and speciﬁcations must be prepared by a registered, licensed, or certiﬁed general contractor, renovation consultant, or architect. The plans and speciﬁcations should fully describe all of the work to be done and provide an indication of when various jobs or stages of completion will be scheduled (including both the start and completion dates).
The lender must use the plans and speciﬁcations to document and evaluate the quantity, quality, and cost of the renovation work that is to be done and to determine the amount of ﬁnancing that will be available. These plans and speciﬁcations also must be used by the appraiser in the development of their opinion of the “as completed” value of the property.
Published February 5, 2025
719
Before approving any change a borrower wants to make to the original plans and speciﬁcations, the lender must require the borrower to submit a HomeStyle Change Order Request (Form 1200) or a substantially similar document, that provides a detailed description of
the changes,
the cost of the changes, and
the estimated completion date(s).
Unplanned Changes in Scope or Incomplete Work
Lenders must work with borrowers and contractors to ensure renovations are completed as planned, within an acceptable timeframe. If unforeseen circumstances occur during the renovation work, such as property damage from a natural or manmade disaster, or a life altering event such as death or divorce, the lender must take additional steps to evaluate the materiality of the change to any renovations in progress.
The lender must obtain an updated appraisal to determine whether the changes will impact the “as completed” value of the property, and must self-report any change in value by entering it into Loan Quality Connect. In some cases, the lender may be responsible for additional mortgage insurance or LLPAs. When the new LTV exceeds Fannie Mae’s eligibility criteria, or the changes result in a home that does not meet Fannie Mae’s general property standards and appraisal requirements, the lender may be required to repurchase the loan.

Costs and Escrow Accounts Contingency Reserve Escrowing Initial Mortgage Payments
Published February 5, 2025

Renovation Escrow Account
Costs and Escrow Accounts
The costs of the renovations will be based on the plans and speciﬁcations for the work and on the contractor’s bids for all of the work requested by the borrower. The renovation costs may include a contingency reserve, renovation-related costs, and an escrow for mortgage payments that come due during the renovation period, if the borrower is unable to occupy the property during the renovation.
Contingency Reserve
The contingency reserve should cover all renovation-related costs including labor, materials, fees, permits, plans and speciﬁcations, inspection costs, and other expenses related to the renovation.
A contingency reserve is not required for a mortgage secured by a one-unit property, however the lender may choose to establish one. A contingency reserve equal to 10% of the total costs of the repairs and renovation work must be established and funded for a mortgage that is secured by a two- to four-unit property to cover required unforeseen repairs or deﬁciencies that are discovered during the renovation. The lender may increase the contingency reserve to 15% if it determines the higher reserve is appropriate given the scope and scale of the renovation.
The contingency reserve may be considered as part of the total renovation costs or the borrower may fund it separately. It may be released only if required, necessary, and unforeseen repairs or deﬁciencies are discovered during the renovation. Unused contingency funds, unless they were received directly from the borrower, must be used to reduce the outstanding balance of the renovation loan after all of the renovation work has been completed and the certiﬁcation of completion has been obtained.
However, a borrower may use the remaining contingency reserve funds for making additional improvements or repairs to the property, if the lender:
warrants that the work scheduled and described in the plans and speciﬁcations was completed and the contingency reserve funds have already been reduced by any cost overruns; and
ensures that
the contingency reserve funds that are to be used for additional improvements or repairs are actually used to improve the real property,
the improvements or repairs are documented with paid receipts from the borrower’s own funds, and
inspections of the additional work or installations are completed by the appraiser who prepared the “as completed” value appraisal report.
Escrowing Initial Mortgage Payments
At the borrower’s request, up to six mortgage payments (PITIA) that will become due during the renovation period may be included as part of the total renovation costs for a principal residence property if the property
Published February 5, 2025
721
cannot be occupied during the renovation period. The lender, servicer, or its agent must hold the funds in a renovation escrow account, and only apply them to payments that come due during the period in which the property cannot be occupied.
Note: The lender may set up a separate escrow account for the mortgage payments in lieu of including the funds in the renovation escrow account.
Renovation Escrow Account
The renovation costs (less any draws made at closing), the contingency reserve, mortgage payments (if applicable), and monies that the borrower provides from their own funds, must be deposited into an escrow account for the beneﬁt of the borrower. The renovation escrow account must meet the requirements shown in the following table at the time of delivery to Fannie Mae.

Renovation Escrow Account Requirements
The account must meet the requirements of and be administered in accordance with the
requirements in the Servicing Guide, D1-2-01, Renovation Mortgage Loans.
The funds must be used to complete the repair and renovation work and, if applicable, make any
mortgage payments that come due during the renovation period.

purpose and are not used for renovations or any other reason.

and renovations are completed in a timely manner and in accordance with the plans,
speciﬁcations, and contractor estimated bids.
The lender must release funds from this account only when any given renovation work has been
completed, and then only in accordance with the agreed-upon schedule and after receipt of a
speciﬁc request.
Renovation funds may only be disbursed using the following processes: a check issued jointly
to the borrower and the contractor; or
a wire transfer to the contractor after the lender has obtained written consent from the
borrower to release the funds to the contractor. The written consent must be received prior to
each disbursement. It must specify the borrower’s name, property address, amount of funds to
be disbursed, contractor to which the funds are to be disbursed, and date of the consent.

Renovation Escrow Account Requirements
After renovations are complete, all funds remaining in this account, including any mortgage
payment reserves, may be used to either:
reduce the unpaid principal balance of the loan (unless they represent funds deposited
separately by the borrower), or
to make additional improvements or repairs to the property.
Note: The lender may fund up to 50% of the planned materials cost at closing with an initial materials draw. A portion of this draw may be used to pay for permits, architect fees, and design or planning expenses that were incurred during the initial part of the project.The lender must obtain periodic inspections to conﬁrm the work is being completed as planned prior to the issuance of additional escrow draws.
Should there be an increase in costs during the renovation period, the borrower, or the lender, must fund the amount of the increase. The lender may not increase the loan amount to oﬀset any increase in costs. The lender must ensure that the additional funds are obtained in a manner that will not aﬀect the priority of Fannie Mae’s lien.

documented on the Appraisal Update and/or Completion Report (Form 1004D). The 1004D must conﬁrm all “subject to” items listed on the appraisal were completed. If deviations have been made to the initial plans, the appraiser must note any impact to the value. If the value has been impacted, the lender must follow the policy in UnplannedChanges in Scope or Incomplete Work in B5-3.2-03, HomeStyle Renovation Mortgages: Collateral Considerations.
The lender must also obtain a certiﬁcate of occupancy upon completion of renovation if it is required by local authorities for the type of renovation work that was completed.
Title and Insurance Updates
Concurrent with the last disbursement of funds, the lender must obtain a title update through the date the renovation was completed, to ensure the continuance of Fannie Mae’s ﬁrst lien priority and the absence of any mechanic's or materialmen’s liens. When the property is located in a state in which contractors’, subcontractors’, or materialmen’s liens have priority over mortgage liens, the lender must obtain all necessary lien releases or take any other action that may be required to ensure title to the property is clear of all liens and encumbrances.
The lender also must retain in the loan ﬁle a certiﬁcation regarding the adequacy of the property insurance following completion of the renovation. The certiﬁcation must conﬁrm the coverage has been increased, if necessary, to comply with Fannie Mae’s standard property and ﬂood insurance requirements.

Introduction This topic contains information on HomeStyle Renovation documents, including:
Renovation Contract Renovation Loan Agreement Lien Waiver
Renovation Contract
The renovation contract must
itemize the speciﬁc work that the contractor agrees to perform for the borrower;
state the agreed-upon cost of the renovation;
Published February 5, 2025
724
identify all subcontractors and suppliers; and
include an itemized description that establishes the schedule for completing each stage of the work and the corresponding payments to be made to the contractor.
This contract, which must be fully executed by both the contractor and the borrower prior to closing, must require the contractor to
be duly licensed (if required by applicable law);
obtain all required insurance coverages (such as all-risk, public liability, workmen’s compensation, and automobile liability);
complete the work in compliance with the contract and all applicable government regulations (such as building codes and zoning restrictions);
obtain the necessary building permits (including a certiﬁcate of occupancy, upon completion of renovations, if required by local law); and
provide for appropriate remedies for resolving disputes (including an agreement to indemnify the borrower for all property losses or damages caused by the contractor’s employees or subcontractors).
Fannie Mae has developed a model Renovation Contract (Form 3730) to document the renovation contract between the borrower and the contractor.
The lender must keep a copy of the fully executed renovation contract in the loan ﬁle.
HomeStyle Renovation mortgages may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations, based on the type of transaction or the types of lenders originating the mortgages. Therefore, when Fannie Mae’s model document is used, all appropriate, required changes must be made.
Renovation Loan Agreement
A renovation loan agreement is a written agreement between the borrower and the lender. This agreement must be fully executed by both the lender and the borrower. Both parties may execute the agreement any time during the closing process, however, the agreement date must match the note date. The agreement must
state the original principal amount of the related promissory note payable to the lender;
include the property address;
state the terms and conditions of the loan prior to the completion of the improvements;
state the events that constitute a borrower default, including, but not limited to, failing to keep any promise or to perform any obligation in the agreement;
indicate the remedies available to the lender if the borrower defaults under the terms of either the renovation contract or other loan documents;
require the contractor to have any license required by any government regulations, and to obtain and keep in force an all-risk insurance policy (with a physical loss form endorsement and a mortgagee’s loss payable clause) equal to 100% of the full replacement cost of the improvements, public liability insurance, workmen’s compensation insurance (as required by applicable state law), and automobile liability insurance;
Published February 5, 2025
725
require that either the borrower or the contractor obtain (and keep in force) all work permits required by any government agency, and comply with all applicable laws or government regulations;
require the borrower to
submit to the lender a title policy and assist the lender in obtaining the appraisal and a survey;
agree that all renovation work will be completed no later than 15 months from the date the loan is closed and in accordance with the terms of the renovation contract (subject to approved change orders);
permit the lender to make property inspections; and
pay all costs and expenses required to satisfy any conditions of the agreement (including costs overruns, the costs of change orders, and the costs of enforcement of the agreement in the event of default);
state the terms and conditions under which the lender may extend the 15 month completion deadline if the renovation cannot be completed on time (due to extenuating circumstances outside of the borrower's control), including
limiting any extension to no later than 18 months after the loan closing; and
requiring any extension to be in writing and the borrower to not be in default under any of the terms of the loan documents or the renovation contract;
include provisions related to
the time, manner, and method by which the lender disburses the loan proceeds;
conditions on how the disbursements may be used;
procedures on how to request a disbursement (including the proper format, information, and required signatories);
documentation required to support each request for disbursement (such as the title policy, any required lien waivers from all contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers) and any required inspection reports;
the number and amount of payments that the lender is to make to the borrower and/or the contractor; and
obligate the borrower and the contractor to enter into a renovation contract for all labor and materials to renovate the improvements, and provide the lender with a copy of
that contract;
the applicable plans and speciﬁcations that fully describe all work to be performed;
the renovation budget (which provides a timetable for stages of completion and the schedule for disbursements for payment of amounts due);
a schedule of disbursements for payment of the renovation costs; and
the requirements for requesting (and obtaining approval of) change orders.
Fannie Mae has developed a model Renovation Loan Agreement (Form 3731) to document the renovation loan agreement between the borrower and the lender.
Because HomeStyle Renovation mortgages may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations based on the type of transaction or the type of lender originating the mortgages, a lender that uses Fannie Mae’s model
Published February 5, 2025
726
documents must make all appropriate, required changes to them.
The fully executed renovation loan agreement is a custodial document. The lender must maintain a copy of the agreement in the loan ﬁle and send the original to the document custodian as part of the loan delivery package (see E-2-01, Required Custodial Documents, for additional information).
Lien Waiver
Before a lender makes the ﬁnal disbursement upon the completion of renovation, it must obtain a lien waiver from the contractor, all subcontractors, and suppliers or a clear title report that releases all contractor, subcontractor, and supplier liens. Fannie Mae’s model document—Lien Waiver (Form 3739)—may be used for this, provided the lender makes any changes to it that are required by applicable law.

Overview
There are a number of HomeStyle Energy ﬁnancing options available to a borrower who wishes to improve the energy and/or water eﬃciency of an existing property and decrease its related utility costs. HomeStyle Energy may also be used to create home resiliency for environmental disasters such as ﬂoods, storms, and earthquakes, or to repair damage from these types of disasters.
There is no minimum dollar amount for the improvements; the maximum dollar amount depends on the type of HomeStyle Energy activity and the transaction, described in the table below.

Note: Lenders may use HomeStyle Energy ﬁnancing in conjunction with HomeStyle Renovation to ﬁnance energy-related improvements that exceed the amounts in the table above. See Section B5–3.2, HomeStyle Renovation Mortgage, for the requirements.
A lender does not need special approval to deliver HomeStyle Energy loans to Fannie Mae.
A lender may deliver a HomeStyle Energy loan with eligible improvements as soon as the loan is closed. The
Published February 5, 2025
728
eligible improvements do not have to be completed when the mortgage is delivered to Fannie Mae. HomeStyle Energy loans are not subject to recourse.
The lender must establish a completion escrow for incomplete energy improvements. The improvements must be completed no later than 180 days from the date of the mortgage note. For requirements related to the completion of the postponed improvements, including escrow accounts, disposition of funds after work completion, and title reports, see the applicable table in B4-1.2-05, Requirements for Verifying Completion and Postponed Improvements.
The term "energy-related improvements" is used throughout this Guide, and includes all eligible improvements described in this topic. All energy-related improvements must be permanently aﬃxed to the property except for certain appliances installed with kitchen and utility room remodels when completed as part of a HomeStyle Renovation loan. See B5-3.2-01, HomeStyle Renovation Mortgages, for additional information.
Eligible Energy-Related Improvements
In addition to energy and water eﬃciency improvements, HomeStyle Energy can be used to repair homes damaged in a natural disaster or by an environmental hazard and to install resiliency or preventative improvements, including the following:
storm surge barriers;
foundation retroﬁtting for earthquakes;
hazardous brush and tree removal in ﬁre zones;
retaining walls to address mud or water ﬂows; and
other items speciﬁcally needed to either repair environmental hazard damage or improve the home’s ability to withstand environmental hazards such as hurricanes, tornadoes or wind storms, earthquakes, ﬂooding, landslides, and wildﬁres.
Installation of radon remediation systems is also an eligible improvement under HomeStyle Energy.
ENERGY STAR-Certiﬁed Improvements
HomeStyle Energy can be used to ﬁnance energy-related improvements that are included in the List of ENERGY STAR Eﬃcient Products.
Eligible Property and Occupancy Types
All one- to four-unit existing properties are eligible for HomeStyle Energy. All property types are eligible. Manufactured homes are eligible provided the improvements do not include structural changes.
All occupancy types are permitted.
Product Eligibility
Energy-related improvements are permitted on existing properties in conjunction with all standard Guide
Published February 5, 2025
729
products and features including, but not limited to:
high-balance loans,
Community Seconds,
loans with deed restrictions (including programs that allow below market rate mortgages),
down payment assistance programs,
HomeReady loans, and
Community Land Trusts.
Loans with energy-related improvements are subject to the applicable LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios for purchase and limited cash-out reﬁnance transactions found in the Eligibility Matrix. Energy-related improvements cannot be ﬁnanced in the loan amount of a high LTV reﬁnance loan.
Note: Energy-related improvements are permitted on a cash-out reﬁnance, however the transaction is not considered a HomeStyle Energy loan. All standard cash-out reﬁnance policies apply.
Purchase Transactions: In a purchase transaction, the proceeds can be used to ﬁnance the acquisition of the property and the cost of energy-related improvements or the amount to payoﬀ PACE debt. The LTV ratio is determined by dividing the original loan amount by the lesser of
the “as completed” appraised value of the property
the sum of the purchase price of the property plus the cost of the energy-related improvements, or
the sum of the purchase price plus the total amount of PACE debt to be paid oﬀ.
Limited Cash-out Reﬁnance Transactions: When a loan is originated as a limited cash-out reﬁnance, the loan must meet all of the standard requirements for limited cash-out reﬁnances (as described in B2-1.3-02, Limited Cash-Out Reﬁnance Transactions).
Energy-related improvements may be ﬁnanced in the loan amount. Proceeds may also be used to pay oﬀ an existing PACE loan or other debt (secured or unsecured) that ﬁnanced energy-related improvements. The standard cash back allowance of the lesser of 2% of the loan amount or $2,000 is permitted on these loans.
For limited cash-out reﬁnance transactions, the LTV ratio is determined by dividing the original loan amount by the “as completed” appraised value of the property when the mortgage is being delivered prior to the completion of the improvements. If the appraisal was completed after the completion of the improvements, then the LTV ratio is determined by dividing the original loan amount by the appraised value of the property.
Energy Report Requirements
Borrowers are required to obtain a residential or home energy report to identify the recommended energy improvements to the property and the estimated cost savings associated with those improvements when they are using funds for new energy-related improvements.
The energy report must be reviewed by the lender and must
identify the recommended energy improvements and expected costs of the completed improvements;
Published February 5, 2025
730
specify the monthly energy savings to the borrower; and
verify that the recommended energy improvements are cost-eﬀective. Energy improvements are determined to be cost-eﬀective when the cost of the improvements, including maintenance, is less than the present value of the energy saved over the useful life of the improvements. (The cost-eﬀectiveness of the improvements may be assessed in the aggregate and are not required to be assessed separately for each energy improvement.)
The report must meet at least one of the following standards:
A Home Energy Rating Systems (HERS) report completed by a HERS rater who is accredited under the Mortgage Industry National Home Energy Rating Standards (HERS Standards), as adopted by the Residential Energy Services Network (RESNET®). A list of accredited HERS raters by state can be located at RESNET’s website.
A Department of Energy (DOE) Home Energy Score Report completed by an independent third-party energy assessor with credentials obtained through one or more of the organizations listed as eligible under the DOE program. A list of acceptable organizations can be found on the DOE website.
A rating report completed by an independent and certiﬁed home energy consultant or auditor, comparable in rating methods and scope to the HERS or Home Energy Score evaluation, and that is permitted under a local or state level home energy certiﬁcation or audit program.
The energy report must be dated no more than 24 months before the note date.
If the cost of the energy report is paid for by the borrower, the cost may be ﬁnanced as part of the mortgage by including it in the cost of the energy improvements. The cost must be included on the settlement statement if it is ﬁnanced in the mortgage loan.
Exceptions to Energy Report Requirements: Energy reports are not required in certain circumstances. Alternative documentation (other than an energy report) is acceptable in the following circumstances:
Weatherization items – If the transaction only involves ﬁnancing the purchase of basic weatherization items (such as programmable thermostats and insulation) or water eﬃciency devices (such as low-ﬂow showerheads) totaling up to $3,500. Acceptable documentation includes, but is not limited to, a copy of invoices or receipts for energy-related expenses or copies of contractor invoices for completing the basic weatherization items.
Payoﬀ of PACE loans – Documentation must show that the funds are used solely to pay oﬀ the PACE loan obtained for energy improvements on the subject property.
Payoﬀ of non-PACE energy-related debt - Documentation must show the funds were used solely for the purchase and installation of eligible energy-related improvements on the subject property.
Energy improvements related to the installation of renewable energy sources including water eﬃciency devices, solar panels, wind power devices, and geothermal systems - Acceptable documentation includes, but is not limited to, a copy of invoices or receipts for installing the systems or devices.
ENERGY STAR-certiﬁed products - The lender must maintain documentation in the loan ﬁle that shows the energy-related improvement is on the List of ENERGY STAR Energy Eﬃcient Products.
Improvements to install a radon remediation device - Documentation for the cost of the system and its expected impact on the radon levels in the home must be obtained.
Environmental hazard damage repairs or resiliency improvements - Acceptable documentation includes,
Published February 5, 2025
731
but is not limited to, a copy of invoices or receipts for the expenses or copies of contractor invoices for completing the repairs or improvements.
Underwriting with DU
Loans using HomeStyle Energy ﬂexibilities can be underwritten manually or through DU.
For loans underwritten in DU, speciﬁc information must be provided in the online loan application in Section L1 as follows:
Energy Improvement - Select the applicable check boxes.
Energy improvements included in transaction - Enter the amount of new energy improvements that are included in the purchase or limited cash-out transaction, and any non-PACE energy debt being paid oﬀ with the limited cash-out transaction. Non-PACE energy debt included in this ﬁeld should not be included in Section L4 Line D.
Payoﬀ Amount of any PACE loan - Enter the payoﬀ amount of any existing PACE loans that will be paid oﬀ in the subject transaction. PACE energy debt should not be included in Section L4 Line D.
Manual Underwriting
For loans involving energy-related improvements that are underwritten manually, a maximum debt-to-income ratio of 45% is allowed if the transaction satisﬁes all criteria in the Eligibility Matrix for a 45% DTI ratio on a manually underwritten loan.
When the transaction does not meet the requirements for an expanded DTI ratio up to 45%, the borrower may have a DTI ratio up to 38% (instead of 36% DTI ratio) when the lender obtains a DOE Home Energy Score Report on the subject property with a score of 6 or higher. All other underwriting requirements, such as the down payment, credit score, and reserve requirements, are identical to those for a similar transaction with a maximum DTI ratio of 36%. If the lender obtained a comparable industry energy eﬃciency report that demonstrates the property has met the standards for increased energy eﬃciency, that report may be used to all for a DTI ratio up to 38%. This DTI ratio ﬂexibility is not permitted on transactions for which no energy report was obtained.
Appraisal Requirements
All HomeStyle Energy loans require an appraisal based on an interior and exterior property inspection and must be completed on the appropriate form depending on the property type. When the loan is being delivered prior to the completion of the energy-related improvements, appraisers must determine the “as completed” value of the property subject to the improvements being completed. A certiﬁcation of completion is required when the mortgage is delivered prior to the completion of the improvements. For requirements related to the certiﬁcation of completion, see B4-1.2-05, Requirements for Verifying Completion and Postponed Improvements.
Lender Responsibilities
Published February 5, 2025
732
The lender is responsible for
ensuring that the appraiser has been provided with a copy of the energy report, if one was required, and other required documentation described in this topic,
managing the completion escrow account in which improvement funds are held, and
monitoring the completion of the HomeStyle Energy improvement work.
See the requirements related to the energy-related improvement feature in B4-1.2-05, Requirements for Verifying Completion and Postponed Improvements.
The lender must maintain a copy of all documentation in the individual loan ﬁle that supports the energy-related improvement work, such as the energy report, “as completed” appraisal, home improvement contract, certiﬁcation of completion, and title insurance endorsements or updates (if applicable).
Loan-Level Price Adjustment Credit
Fannie Mae will credit the lender a $500 LLPA for loans with ﬁnanced energy-related improvements on existing properties. SFC 375 must be delivered for the credit to be applied. See the Loan-Level Price Adjustment (LLPA) Matrix .
Special Feature Codes
The following SFCs are required for loans with eligible energy-related improvements. These codes also apply to delivery of HomeStyle Renovation loans with energy-related improvements.

Section B5-3.4, Property Assessed Clean Energy Loans
B5-3.4-01, Property Assessed Clean Energy Loans (12/16/2020)
Introduction This topic contains information on Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) loans, including:
Overview Eligibility Reﬁnancing Options for Properties with a PACE Loan Delivery Requirements
Overview
Certain energy retroﬁt lending programs, often referred to as Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) programs, are made by localities to ﬁnance residential energy-related improvements and are generally repaid through the homeowner’s real estate tax bill. These loans typically have automatic ﬁrst lien priority over previously recorded mortgages. The terms of the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Uniform Security Instruments prohibit loans that have
Published February 5, 2025
734
senior lien status to a mortgage.
Eligibility
Fannie Mae will not purchase mortgage loans secured by properties with an outstanding PACE loan unless the terms of the PACE loan program do not provide for lien priority over ﬁrst mortgage liens. Lenders must monitor state and local law to determine which jurisdictions oﬀer PACE loans that may provide for lien priority.
If the PACE loan is structured as a subordinate lien or unsecured loan, the ﬁrst mortgage loan may be underwritten to Fannie Mae’s standard guidelines.
However, for PACE loans originated prior to July 6, 2010, Fannie Mae waives the uniform security instrument prohibition against a PACE loan with lien priority if the corresponding mortgage loan was purchased before July 6, 2010 or is in an MBS pool with an issue date on or before July 1, 2010.
Note: On the Form 1003 (1/2021) the borrower must indicate if the property will be subject to a PACE lien that will take priority over the ﬁrst mortgage lien in Section 5a E. The lender must indicate if the property is currently subject to a a PACE lien that will take priority over the ﬁrst mortgage lien in Section L1.
Reﬁnancing Options for Properties with a PACE Loan
The following requirements apply to borrowers with loans that are owned or securitized by Fannie Mae who seek to reﬁnance and who obtained a PACE loan prior to July 6, 2010:
Paying oﬀ the PACE loan: The lender must ﬁrst attempt to qualify the borrower for either a cash-out or limited cash-out reﬁnance option, with the PACE loan being paid oﬀ as part of the reﬁnance. To mitigate the risk posed by PACE obligations that take lien priority over the mortgage, Fannie Mae requires that borrowers with suﬃcient equity pay oﬀ the existing PACE obligation as a condition to obtaining a new mortgage loan. The prohibition against using the proceeds of a limited cash-out reﬁnance to pay oﬀ a loan not used to purchase the property will not apply.
Loan caseﬁles underwritten in DU as a limited cash-out reﬁnance may receive an Ineligible recommendation when it appears the borrower is receiving more than 2%/$2,000 cash back due to the payoﬀ of a PACE loan. The lender may deliver the loan with the Ineligible recommendation and retain the DU limited waiver of underwriting representations and warranties provided that the mortgage loan meets the requirements of this Guide, including (but not limited to) A2-2-04, Limited Waiver and Enforcement Relief of Representations and Warranties
Retaining the PACE loan: If the borrower is unable to qualify for a cash-out or limited cash-out reﬁnance with suﬃcient proceeds to pay oﬀ the PACE loan, the lender may underwrite the loan as a limited cash-out reﬁnance, with the PACE loan remaining in place. In these cases, it will not be necessary to include the PACE loan in the calculation of the CLTV ratio, though it must be included in the monthly housing expense (PITIA) and debt-to-income calculation.
Delivery Requirements
For those eligible limited cash-out reﬁnances where the PACE loan remains in place, the loans must be delivered

Chapter B5-4, Property-Speciﬁc Products
Introduction
This chapter describes the policies and requirements for property-speciﬁc products.
Section B5-4.1, General Requirements of Texas Section 50(a)(6) Loans
B5-4.1-01, Texas Section 50(a)(6) Loans (12/19/2017)
Introduction This topic contains information on Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans, including:
Overview Lender Eligibility Loan Origination and Compliance Lender Certiﬁcation Lender’s and Servicer’s Obligations to Maintain Procedures for Curing Violations
Overview
Published February 5, 2025
736
A Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan is a loan originated in accordance with and secured by a lien permitted under the provisions of Article XVI, Section 50(a)(6), of the Texas Constitution, which allow a borrower to take equity out of a homestead property under certain conditions.
Lender Eligibility
Unless otherwise notiﬁed in writing, all lenders are eligible to sell and/or service Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans as long as the lender meets the eligibility criteria speciﬁed in Texas Constitution Section 50(a)(6). A lender that intends to sell Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans originated by a third-party originator is also responsible for ensuring that the originating lender qualiﬁes as an “authorized lender” under Texas Constitution Section 50(a)(6).
Loan Origination and Compliance
In addition to Fannie Mae's other origination and compliance requirements for Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans in this chapter, lender agrees to the following:
✓
Requirement
The borrower’s ﬁrst payment must be due no later than two months after closing.
For purposes of the compliance with the acknowledgment of the “fair market” value of the
homestead property requirement, the “fair market value” must be based on an appraisal and
the appraisal must be attached to the written acknowledgment. See B5-4.1-03, Texas Section
50(a)(6) Loan Underwriting, Collateral, and Closing Considerations for Fannie Mae's appraisal
requirements.
The proceeds from a Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan must not be used to acquire or improve the
homestead if a loan for that purpose could have been made under a diﬀerent provision of the
Texas Constitution.
Fannie Mae has no other restrictions on the use of the loan proceeds.
If the new loan is a Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan reﬁnance transaction originated to cure a
failure in the original loan to comply with Texas Constitution Section 50(a)(6), then the new
loan is eligible for sale to Fannie Mae provided that it complies in all respects with Fannie
Mae’s requirements. However, unless a reﬁnance transaction has been completed to cure a
failure in the original loan transaction to comply with Texas Constitution Section 50(a)(6), a
Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan is ineligible for sale to Fannie Mae if the lender has either
identiﬁed or been notiﬁed by the borrower of a failure to comply, whether or not there has
already been a cure or an attempt to cure the failure to comply.
Published February 5, 2025
737
✓
Requirement
DU does not contain the speciﬁc eligibility rules needed to determine eligibility of Texas
Section 50(a)(6) loans under Texas Constitution Section 50(a)(6) or the Selling Guide.
Lenders must determine whether reﬁnance loans secured by properties in Texas are eligible
for sale to Fannie Mae, and should be aware that even though a loan may receive an “Eligible”
recommendation, the loan may not comply with Texas Constitution Section 50(a)(6) or be
eligible for delivery according to Texas Constitution Section 50(a)(6) or the Selling Guide
.
Lender Certiﬁcation
By sale of a Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan to Fannie Mae, the lender represents, warrants, and certiﬁes that with respect to all of the Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans delivered to Fannie Mae, whether or not originated by the lender:
All Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans were originated pursuant to written processes and procedures that comply with the provisions of the Texas Constitution applicable to mortgage loans.
The lender has in place a speciﬁc process for the receipt, handling, and monitoring of notices from borrowers that lender (or the mortgage originator, if lender is the servicer but not the originator) failed to comply with the provisions of the law applicable to Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans. Such process must be adequate to ensure that the lender will correct the failure to comply by one of the authorized means no later than the 60th day after the date the lender is notiﬁed of the failure to comply by the borrower.
An attorney familiar with the provisions of Texas Constitution Section 50(a)(6) was consulted in connection with the development and implementation of the processes and procedures used for the origination of the Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans.
To ensure ongoing compliance with the law applicable to loans authorized by Texas Constitution Section 50(a)(6), the processes and procedures used for the origination of the Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans will be reviewed by the lender regularly and will be updated and revised, as appropriate pursuant to clariﬁcations of the law, on a regular and continual basis.
Lender’s and Servicer’s Obligations to Maintain Procedures for Curing Violations
Lenders and servicers must have speciﬁc processes in place to cure any failure to comply with Texas Constitution Section 50(a)(6) identiﬁed with respect to a loan sold to or serviced on behalf of Fannie Mae by one of the authorized means, as required by the “Lender Certiﬁcation” requirements described above. A lender’s or servicer’s failure to cure within 60 days after being notiﬁed of a failure to comply may, under Texas law, result in the forfeiture of all principal and interest due under the Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan. However, any action taken, or not taken, in connection with a failure to comply with Texas Constitution Section 50(a)(6), even if such action is a result of the lender’s or servicer’s eﬀort to cure a failure to comply, that results in any of the following constitutes a breach of the lender’s selling representations and warranties and/or servicing obligations and requirements:
Published February 5, 2025
738
a forfeiture of any principal or interest due under the mortgage loan;
invalidation of the mortgage as a ﬁrst lien;
abatement of accrual of interest and the borrower’s obligations under the mortgage loan;
reduction in the principal amount of the mortgage loan; or
any modiﬁcation of the amount, interest rate, term, or other provision of the mortgage loan.
Such action, taken or not taken, shall be deemed a failure to correct a signiﬁcant defect and/or a servicing defect that permits Fannie Mae to exercise any of the remedies provided in the Lender Contract, including the right to require repurchase of the loan.
If the lender or servicer receives notice from a borrower that a lender (or the mortgage originator, if the lender or the servicer is not the originator) failed to comply with Texas Constitution Section 50(a)(6), the lender or servicer must immediately, but no later than seven business days after receipt, take the following actions:
inform Fannie Mae’s Legal department by submitting a Non-Routine Litigation (Form 20) and include the borrower notice in its submission; and,
collaborate with Fannie Mae on the appropriate response, including any cure that may be necessary, within the 60-day-time frame provided by the requirements of Texas Constitution Section 50(a)(6).

B5-4.1-02, Texas Section 50(a)(6) Loan Eligibility (12/16/2020)
Introduction This topic contains information on Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan eligibility, including:
Reﬁnance Classiﬁcations Eligible Loan Products and Transaction Types Texas Section 50(a)(6) Loan Security Property
Reﬁnance Classiﬁcations
Lenders should be aware that Fannie Mae’s classiﬁcation of loan transactions as “cash-out reﬁnance” or “limited cash-out reﬁnance” may diﬀer from the way loans are classiﬁed under Texas law.
Lenders should not rely on Fannie Mae’s categorization of reﬁnance loans for purposes of determining whether compliance with the provisions of Texas Constitution Section 50(a)(6) is required. Rather, such lenders should consult with their counsel to determine the applicability of Texas Constitution Section 50(a)(6) to a particular loan transaction.
Published February 5, 2025
739
Texas law determines whether or not a loan is a Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan, and Fannie Mae’s policy determines whether the loan must be delivered as a cash-out reﬁnance transaction or as a limited cash-out reﬁnance transaction.
The lender is responsible for determining:
the applicability of Texas Constitution Section 50(a)(6) regardless of Fannie Mae’s deﬁnitions of cash-out and limited cash-out reﬁnance transactions; and
if the loan should be delivered to Fannie Mae as a cash-out reﬁnance or a limited cash-out reﬁnance transaction, including the applicable special feature codes and payment of all applicable LLPAs.
All loans that constitute Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans under Texas law must comply with these provisions, regardless of whether the loan is classiﬁed as a “cash-out reﬁnance” or “limited cash-out reﬁnance” in the Selling Guide. See B5-4.1-03, Texas Section 50(a)(6) Loan Underwriting, Collateral, and Closing Considerations
For any reﬁnance of a Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan that results in a loan originated in accordance with and secured by a lien permitted by Article XVI, Section 50(a)(4) of the Texas Constitution, an aﬃdavit referenced in Section 50(f-1) Article XVI of the Texas Constitution must be prepared and recorded in connection with each such transaction.
Eligible Loan Products and Transaction Types
Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans must be fully amortizing loans with payments due on a monthly basis. The following are eligible as Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans:
ﬁrst lien mortgages only;
ﬁxed-rate loans; and
ﬁve-, seven-, and ten-year ARM plans (4927, 4928, and 4929 Texas 50(a)(6), respectively).
Note: These ARM plans should be structured in the same way that they are for other loans, except that the loan may not be assumable at any time over its full term. Only the ARM plans listed above are eligible, due to the MBS disclosure impact resulting from the non-assumable nature of these ARMs.
The following are not eligible as Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans:
loans that are not in ﬁrst-lien position,
ARM plans not listed above, and
loans with temporary interest rate buydowns.
Texas Section 50(a)(6) Loan Security Property
A Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan must be secured by a single-unit principal residence constituting the borrower’s homestead under Texas law. Loans secured by two- to four-unit properties, investment properties, or second homes are not eligible. The security property may be
Published February 5, 2025
740
a detached dwelling,
an attached dwelling,
a unit in a PUD project,
a unit in a condo project, or
a manufactured home. (A manufactured home is eligible only if it is classiﬁed as real property under Texas law, and satisﬁes all special Fannie Mae eligibility criteria for manufactured homes.)
The borrower’s homestead property may not exceed the applicable acreage limit as determined by Texas law when the Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan is originated.
A borrower that owns adjacent land must submit appropriate evidence, such as a survey, that the mortgaged homestead property is a separate parcel that does not exceed the permissible acreage.
Note: An inter vivos revocable trust that meets Fannie Mae's borrower eligibility criteria (as described in B2-2-05, Inter Vivos Revocable Trusts), may be a borrower under a Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan, provided that the trust meets the requirements for a "qualifying trust" under Texas law for purposes of owning residential property that qualiﬁes for the homestead exemption.

B5-4.1-03, Texas Section 50(a)(6) Loan Underwriting, Collateral, and Closing Considerations (03/01/2023)
Introduction This topic contains information on Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan underwriting, collateral, and closing considerations, including:
LTV/CLTV Ratios Underwriting Property Valuation and Survey Loan Documentation Title Insurance
Published February 5, 2025
741
LTV/CLTV Ratios
Per Texas law, the maximum allowable LTV and combined LTV for any Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan is 80%, notwithstanding any conﬂicting provisions of this Guide or any speciﬁc DU recommendation or ﬁnding. HELOC subordinate ﬁnancing is not permitted, hence a maximum HCLTV ratio is not applicable.
Underwriting
Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans are eligible for the reduced documentation requirements recommended by DU, provided that all other terms and conditions described herein for Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans shall apply.
For a Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan that represents the reﬁnance of a prior Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan, the borrower must requalify even if the lender is currently servicing the existing loan that is being reﬁnanced.
Manually underwritten Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans are subject to minimum credit score requirements per the Selling Guide, based on the transaction as either a cash-out reﬁnance or a limited cash-out reﬁnance, as applicable.
Property Valuation and Survey
Lenders must obtain a new appraisal to determine the property's current value even if DU recommends value acceptance (appraisal waiver), or a value acceptance + property data. The appraisal must be attached to the written acknowledgment of fair value.
The appraisal for the property and the acknowledgment of fair market value must not include any property other than the homestead.
The survey (or other acceptable evidence) must demonstrate that:
the homestead property and any adjacent land are separate parcels, and
the homestead property is a separately platted and subdivided lot for which full ingress and egress is available.
The lender selling the loan to Fannie Mae must not have any interest (such as an option to purchase, a security interest, or an easement) in any parcel adjacent to the homestead property that is owned by the borrower, if such interest could constitute additional security for the Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan.
Loan Documentation
There is a special security instrument, notes, and riders that must be used in connection with Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans and a special aﬃdavit that must be prepared and recorded in connection with each Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan transaction. Lenders must use the following documents:
Published February 5, 2025
742
Texas Home Equity Security Instrument (First Lien) (Form 3044.1)
the speciﬁc Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan notes and riders, and
Texas Home Equity Aﬃdavit and Agreement (First Lien) (Form 3185)
Because of the complexities involved in closing Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans, lenders must provide the title company with a detailed closing instruction letter and require an acknowledgment of its receipt.
The closing instructions must require the title company to conduct its closings properly to ensure compliance with Texas Constitution Section 50(a)(6). To assist in this endeavor, the Texas Home Equity Aﬃdavit and Agreement First Lien (Form 3185) must be prepared and recorded in connection with each Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan transaction.
Fannie Mae suggests that a lender also require each borrower to sign a closing receipt that itemizes the documents that they received at closing.
For additional Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan documentation (also called “Texas Home Equity” documentation) refer to Standard Texas Home Equity Notes (under Standard Instruments).
Note: Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans are not eligible for delivery as eMortgages.
Title Insurance
For all Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans, a title insurance policy written on Texas Land Title Association forms (standard or short form), supplemented by an Equity Loan Mortgage Endorsement (Form T-42) and a Supplemental Coverage Equity Loan Mortgage Endorsement (Form T-42.1), is required.
Note: There may be no exceptions or deletions to the coverage provided by Paragraphs 2(a) through (e) (other than an exception or deletion relating to the exclusion of agricultural homestead property) of the T-42 endorsement. The endorsement must include the optional coverage provided by Paragraph 2(f), as well as the additional coverage provided by Endorsement T-42.1.
The title insurance policy cannot include language that:
excludes coverage for a title defect that arises because ﬁnanced origination expenses are held not to be “reasonable costs necessary to reﬁnance”, or
deﬁnes the “reasonable costs necessary to reﬁnance” requirement as a “consumer credit protection” law since the standard title policy excludes coverage when lien validity is questioned due to a failure to comply with consumer credit protection laws.

Introduction This topic contains information on Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan delivery considerations, including:
Special Feature Codes and Pricing Servicing
Special Feature Codes and Pricing
All Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans must be identiﬁed at delivery with SFC 304. In addition, the lender must enter the following special feature codes at loan delivery:
SFC 003 for each Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan that is classiﬁed as a cash-out reﬁnance under Fannie Mae’s policy, and
SFC 007 for each Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan that is classiﬁed as a limited cash-out reﬁnance under Fannie Mae’s policy.
If the lender determines that a loan secured by a mortgage on a homestead property in Texas is classiﬁed as a cash-out reﬁnance per this Guide but is not a Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan, then the loan should be delivered as a standard (non-Texas Section 50(a)(6) loan) cash-out reﬁnance transaction and should not be identiﬁed with SFC 304.
At delivery, all Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans that are classiﬁed as cash-out reﬁnance transactions are subject to the loan-level price adjustments applicable to cash-out reﬁnance loans per the Lender Contract.
Servicing

Overview
As part of Fannie Mae’s commitment to oﬀering conventional loan products to address special housing needs of the underserved, Fannie Mae developed its set of Native American conventional Housing Initiatives.
Through these initiatives, Fannie Mae purchases conventional mortgages that are made to Native Americans.
Lender Eligibility
Any lender that is interested in participating in NACLI must obtain separate approval from Fannie Mae.
Upon approval, the lender will obtain the applicable set of terms and conditions that may vary for the speciﬁc tribal community.
Eligibility Requirements
Published February 5, 2025

permit the reﬁnance of non-purchase money subordinate loans obtained to ﬁnance disaster-related property repairs, and
provide for a higher cash-out amount to reimburse borrowers for documented out-of-pocket expenses
Published February 5, 2025

related to disaster-related property repairs.
This topic outlines the speciﬁc eligibility requirements for these additional ﬂexibilities.
Location of Property
These ﬂexibilities may be applied to loans on properties located in any counties, cities, or parishes that are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as eligible for Individual Assistance as a result of a natural disaster (these areas are referred to as “FEMA Disaster Areas”).
Occupancy Status
These guidelines are applicable only to loans secured by the borrower’s principal residence, and may not be used in connection with second homes or investment properties.
Transaction Types
A borrower may obtain:
a limited cash-out reﬁnance to consolidate non-purchase money subordinate ﬁnancing used for repair of disaster-related property damage to their principal residence. To be eligible, the subordinate ﬁnancing, including any draws on an existing HELOC, must post-date the disaster. However, the borrower may pay oﬀ the entire HELOC through the limited cash-out reﬁnance, provided that a portion of the amount was used for disaster-related expenses to repair property damage to the principal residence.
cash-out for reimbursement of documented out-of-pocket expenses for the completed repair of disaster- related property damage to their principal residence in an amount not to exceed the lesser of 10% of the balance of the new reﬁnance loan or $15,000.
All existing guidelines and requirements for limited cash-out reﬁnance transactions listed in this section continue to apply, including those for Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans (see B5-4.1-01, Texas Section 50(a)(6) Loans).
Documentation of Eligible Disaster-Related Expenses and Financing
The lender must document that the subordinate ﬁnancing (or a portion of the HELOC) or the entire requested cash-out amount represents funds used for completed disaster-related property repairs.
Generally, documentation includes copies of receipts, work orders, canceled checks, etc., related to the cost of materials and labor.
The borrower may not receive any reimbursement for amounts representing their sweat equity in connection with the repairs.
Note: All documentation must post-date the disaster and be directly related to completed repairs of damage to the property resulting from the disaster.
Published February 5, 2025
747
Limited Cash-Out Reﬁnance DU Requirements
Certain messages on the DU Underwriting Findings Report will not apply to loans originated under the disaster- related limited cash-out reﬁnance requirements.
When the loan complies with the requirements of this section, lenders may disregard the following messages:
This case is ineligible because the amount of cash taken out of the subject property equity exceeds the limit of 2% of the loan amount or $2,000 for limited cash-out reﬁnances.
If any subordinate lien that was not used to acquire the subject property is to be paid oﬀ with ﬁrst mortgage proceeds, the loan is ineligible as a limited cash-out reﬁnance. The loan must be resubmitted as a cash-out reﬁnance.
If subordinate liens are being paid oﬀ with the ﬁrst mortgage proceeds, obtain written documentation that the subordinate lien was used to acquire the subject property.
Fannie Mae will grant the lender the limited waiver of underwriting representations and warranties for these loans, including those mortgages that receive an Approve/Ineligible recommendation, provided the loan meets the requirements contained in this section as well as those contained in A2-2-04, Limited Waiver and Enforcement Relief of Representations and Warranties.
Appraisal Requirements
The appraisal for the property must follow standard requirements contained in Chapter B4–1, Appraisal Guidelines.
Those guidelines allow an appraisal to be based on the “as is” condition of the property provided there are no conditions that aﬀect the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the property. If those conditions do exist, the property must be appraised subject to completion of the speciﬁc alterations or repairs (“as repaired”) and a completion report must be obtained from the appraiser prior to delivery of the mortgage to Fannie Mae.
Delivery
Loans originated in accordance with this section must be delivered to Fannie Mae no later than two years from the date of the disaster declaration by FEMA.
Special Feature Codes
Loans delivered under these guidelines must include SFC 416 as part of the delivery data.

Introduction This topic describes exceptions to standard policies that are permitted for HomePath properties and delivery requirements, including:
Eligibility Exceptions for HomePath Properties Interested Party Contributions Certain Resale Restrictions Special Feature Code for HomePath Properties using the IPC Exception Loan-level Price Adjustment Credit for Appraisals
Eligibility Exceptions for HomePath Properties
A HomePath property is a property that was owned and sold by Fannie Mae through a transaction resulting in the disposition of its real estate owned (REO). When the property secured by the mortgage is a HomePath property, Fannie Mae will allow certain exceptions to standard Selling Guide eligibility policies as described below.
Interested Party Contributions
In cases where the subject property is a HomePath property, an exception to the maximum interested party contribution (IPC) limit for principal residences is permitted, as described in the table below. All other requirements related to IPCs, as described in B3-4.1-02, Interested Party Contributions (IPCs), continue to apply.

Note: DU will issue a message if the amount of the IPC appears to exceed the standard limits described in B3-4.1-02, Interested Party Contributions (IPCs). (DU does not apply the higher limit even if DU identiﬁes the property as a HomePath property.) The lender must determine whether the subject transaction is a purchase of a HomePath property eligible for the higher IPC limit and document the loan ﬁle accordingly.
Certain Resale Restrictions
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Selling Guide, loans subject to resale restrictions imposed by Fannie Mae as the seller of its REO property are eligible.
Published February 5, 2025
749
Special Feature Code for HomePath Properties using the IPC Exception
Lenders must use SFC 679 when delivering a loan secured by a HomePath property if the IPC exception applies to the transaction. This code is in addition to any other special feature codes that may apply. SFC 679 is not required for a loan secured by a HomePath property that is subject solely to the resale restriction exception.
Loan-level Price Adjustment Credit for Appraisals
The lender will receive a $500 loan-level price adjustment credit when Fannie Mae purchases a loan secured by a HomePath property. The following requirements apply:
The loan must be a purchase transaction for a principal residence underwritten with DU. The lender must obtain an appraisal for the transaction and pass the entire credit to the borrower to cover the cost of the appraisal. The lender must conﬁrm the seller of the property is Fannie Mae (even though DU may identify the property as a HomePath property). The loan must be delivered with SFC 871.

Overview
A Community Seconds loan is subordinate ﬁnancing that is originated under an aﬀordable housing program. Fannie Mae does not purchase Community Seconds loans; however, ﬁrst mortgages that are originated with this type of subordinate ﬁnancing are eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae in accordance with the requirements of this Guide.
Review of Community Seconds Programs
The lender is responsible for reviewing Community Seconds programs to ensure the programs comply with this Guide. The Community Seconds Checklist includes a checklist that lenders may use to evaluate key considerations in determining whether to grant approval of a Community Seconds program.
The following table provides lender requirements for reviewing a Community Seconds program.
✓
The lender must...
Review all documents applicable to the program, including the legal documents (such as the
promissory note and the security instrument), the program description, and any other pertinent
documents to conﬁrm compliance with Section B5-5.1, Community Seconds.
Determine the mortgage for the Community Seconds loan is clearly subordinate to the ﬁrst
mortgage. The title insurance in eﬀect must ensure priority of the ﬁrst mortgage being delivered to
Fannie Mae by showing the Community Seconds loan in a subordinate position.
Conﬁrm the program allows the holder of the ﬁrst mortgage to foreclose and acquire title to the
property free and clear of all interests of the Community Seconds provider.
Note: If a Community Seconds provider assumes the ﬁrst mortgage and cures all outstanding
defaults under that mortgage, the Community Seconds ﬁnancing may be maintained.

Eligible Community Seconds Providers Acceptable Uses Additional Eligibility Requirements Rural Development Section 502 Leveraged (Blended) Loan Program Minimum Borrower Contribution Requirements Repayment Structure Pricing and Delivery Considerations
Eligible Community Seconds Providers
A Community Seconds loan must only be funded by one of the following entities:
a federal agency, state, county, or similar political subdivision of a state; any city, town, village, or borough of a state that
has a local government and that has been created by a special legislative act, has been otherwise individually incorporated or chartered pursuant to state law, or

is recognized as such under the constitution or by the laws of the state in which it is located;
a housing ﬁnance agency as deﬁned in 24 C.F.R. §266.5; a nonproﬁt organization exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code; a regional Federal Home Loan Bank under one of its aﬀordable housing programs; an employer where a borrower is an employee (see B3-4.3-08, Employer Assistance); a lender, only in connection with an employer-guaranteed Community Seconds loan as part of its aﬀordable housing program; or an Indian tribe on the most current list published by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to 25 U.S.C. §5131.
Note: A corporation or other legal entity created by or owned in whole or in part by such an Indian tribe is not eligible unless it qualiﬁes as a Tribally Designated Housing Entity, as deﬁned in 25 U.S.C. §4103(22).
A Community Seconds provider must not be the property seller or other interested party in the transaction, except when they are the provider of a shared equity program or sweat equity program. See B5-5.3-03, Shared Equity Transactions: Eligibility, Underwriting and Collateral Requirements and B5-6-02, HomeReady Mortgage Underwriting Methods and Requirements.
Acceptable Uses
A Community Seconds loan must be used to fund one or more of the following:
all or part of the down payment, provided the Community Seconds loan is not funded in any way through the ﬁrst mortgage, such as premium pricing; closing costs; renovations to the property (including energy-related improvements); or a permanent interest rate buydown.
In some cases, a Community Seconds loan may not involve the advancement of funds, but instead may facilitate aﬀordability through a subsidized sales price and/or requirements related to the future sale of the home. The eligible provider may secure a Community Seconds loan against the property representing the diﬀerence between the market value and reduced sales price accepted by the seller (referred to as the subsidy). Typically, the subordinate loan has deferred payments and may be forgiven. The subordinate loan may also enforce requirements that prevent the borrower from selling the property outside of the conﬁnes of the program. The terms of the loan may not, however, restrict the sale of the property upon foreclosure or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.
When a subsidy is provided, the lender may use the Aﬀordable LTV calculation described in B5-5.3-03, Shared Equity Transactions: Eligibility, Underwriting and Collateral Requirements. When a subsidy is provided and the property has resale restrictions that limit both income eligibility and impose a maximum resale price, the provisions in Section B5-5.3, Shared Equity Transactions also apply.

Note: See B5-6-02, HomeReady Mortgage Underwriting Methods and Requirements, for additional information about minimum borrower contribution and down payment requirements, including sweat equity requirements, for HomeReady loans.
Repayment Structure
Repayment of the Community Seconds loan may be structured in any number of ways provided the terms are consistent with those Fannie Mae considers acceptable. This includes:
requiring fully amortizing, equal monthly payments; deferring payments for some period before changing to fully amortizing, equal monthly payments; deferring payments over the entire term, unless the loan is paid oﬀ or the property is sold before the maturity date of the loan; or forgiving debt over time.
When the borrower's employer is the provider of the Community Seconds loan, the ﬁnancing terms may provide for the employer to require full repayment of the debt if the borrower's employment is terminated (either voluntarily or involuntarily, for reasons other than those related to disability) before the maturity date of the Community Seconds loan.
When repayment is required, the maturity date of the Community Seconds loan, or the due date of any balloon payment on the Community Seconds loan, cannot be before the earlier of:
15 years after the note date of the ﬁrst mortgage, or the maturity date of the ﬁrst mortgage.
When repayment of the Community Seconds loan is deferred for ﬁve years or more, a lender is not required to include a monthly payment for the Community Seconds loan in its calculation of the borrower's debt-to-income ratio. When repayment is deferred for fewer than ﬁve years, the lender must include the monthly payment amount that will be required after the end of the deferral period in its calculation.
The Community Seconds loan must be a ﬁxed-rate loan and the interest rate may not be more than 2% (200 basis points) higher than the initial note rate of the ﬁrst mortgage.
Note: Interest that is imposed as a penalty should the loan be declared in default and called due and payable under its terms is not subject to this interest rate cap.
The Community Seconds loan may not allow for negative amortization, however, because negative amortization
Published February 5, 2025

will occur if the interest rate is greater than zero and the payment of interest is ever deferred, negative amortization will be acceptable provided:
the amount of scheduled monthly interest deferred on the Community Seconds loan for any full calendar month within the initial ﬁve years (of the Community Seconds loan) may never exceed the scheduled monthly principal payment of the ﬁrst mortgage for that month (see below for an example); interest is accrued on a simple-interest basis at a ﬁxed rate; and the accrued interest is fully deferred until
sale or transfer of the property, the loan is reﬁnanced or the ﬁrst mortgage is paid in full, or declaration of an event of default under the subordinate note or the security instrument.
Example
In the following example, the ﬁrst mortgage is eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae as the amount of deferred, accrued interest for July on the Community Seconds loan is less than the scheduled principal payment for the ﬁrst mortgage for the same month.

B5-5.1-03, Community Seconds: Shared Appreciation Transactions
(11/01/2023)
Introduction This topic contains information on shared appreciation transactions, including:
Overview Provider Requirements Eligibility Repayment Distribution Requirements Delivery Requirements
Overview
Shared appreciation programs are a type of Community Seconds oﬀering that create aﬀordability for eligible borrowers by providing down payment, closing cost assistance, and/or funding for renovations to the property, including energy-related improvements, in exchange for repayment of an interest-free loan and a share in any future appreciation to the property. The program provider receives the original amount advanced and a predetermined percentage of any appreciation in value upon the occurrence of speciﬁed events deﬁned in the program's legal documentation. Events may include the subsequent sale (or other transfer) of the home and be dependent on the availability of funds.
Appreciation in value is deﬁned as the positive diﬀerence between the original sales price of the property and the subsequent value of the property determined in accordance with the shared appreciation program's legal documents (which may but is not required to take into account amounts paid by the borrower to improve the property with the knowledge or consent of the shared appreciation program).
Note: This topic pertains only to shared appreciation loans. For information on shared equity transactions, see Section B5-5.3, Shared Equity Transactions.
Provider Requirements
The provider of a shared appreciation loan must
be an eligible Community Seconds provider,
Published February 5, 2025
757
be responsible for the administration and oversight of the program, and advance its own funds (or those of other parties for whom it is administering the program, so long as each such party is an eligible Community Seconds provider) to the borrower.
Note: The lender of the ﬁrst mortgage may advance the funds for the shared appreciation loan if within six months of loan closing the lender assigns the loan to a housing ﬁnance agency as deﬁned in 23 C.F.R. §266.5. In this scenario, the housing ﬁnance agency will be considered an acceptable Community Seconds shared appreciation provider.
Eligibility
Shared appreciation loans are only eligible as Community Seconds loans. Fannie Mae will purchase ﬁrst mortgages that are originated with this type of subordinate ﬁnancing, but the ﬁrst mortgage must be a purchase or limited cash-out reﬁnance transaction and otherwise meet the requirements of this Guide.
The following table provides additional eligibility requirements for shared appreciation loans.
✓
Requirements
The shared appreciation loan must comply with the requirements in B5-5.1-01, Community Seconds Loans and B5-5.1-02,
Community Seconds Loan Eligibility.
Interest (deferred or otherwise) is not permitted, other than default interest on overdue principal or a share in appreciation.
Expenses or fees must not be imposed on the borrower after loan origination, except in cases of default or in connection
with borrower-initiated transactions, as deﬁned in the program's legal documentation.
After completion of the obligations to the shared appreciation provider (or its assignee), including payment of any shared
appreciation in value, the borrower must not have any further obligation to the shared appreciation provider or any
assignee.

Published February 5, 2025
Requirements
The shared appreciation loan and any share in appreciation must only be payable in
connection with one or more of the following events as speciﬁed in the shared
appreciation program's legal documentation:
a speciﬁc date, which must not be earlier than the scheduled maturity date of the ﬁrst
mortgage granted in connection with the purchase of the property;
repayment in full of the ﬁrst mortgage (except when the shared appreciation loan is
being resubordinated in connection with a reﬁnance;
acceleration of the ﬁrst mortgage in accordance with its terms (for purchase mortgages
only, this is limited to acceleration after the conclusion of loss mitigation or other
measures to cure a delinquency); or
an unauthorized transfer, or unauthorized change in occupancy status, of the property,
or an event of default relating to the failure to maintain collateral (after notice and an
opportunity to cure).
In addition, the program's legal documents must allow the borrower an option to prepay
the loan in its entirety at any time and to pay all other amounts due to the provider,
including any shared appreciation.
If the shared appreciation loan becomes due and payable, all amounts then due and
payable to the ﬁrst mortgagee must be paid ﬁrst, followed by other entitled parties, such
as the shared appreciation provider and the borrower.
In the program's legal documentation, the appreciation in value must be based on one of
the following:
When the property is sold on the open market, the appreciation must be based on the
actual sales price of the property.
In any other instance, the appreciation must be based on an appraisal from a state-
licensed or state-certiﬁed appraiser obtained in accordance with the program's terms, or if
explicitly indicated as permitted in the program's legal documents, a current value
established by a third-party, commercial automated valuation model (AVM).
For limited cash-out reﬁnances, appreciation in value may be based on any method
included in the program's legal documentation.
759
Criteria
Requirements
Except as permitted below, the provider's share of appreciation must not exceed the
"Standard Percentage" which is derived by dividing the original shared appreciation loan
amount by the original sales price.
For example, if the provider contributed a 10% down payment towards the purchase of a
home, the provider cannot share in appreciation greater than 10% (the Standard
Percentage) when the home is sold.
Exceptions
The provider's share of appreciation may be greater than the Standard Percentage in
either of the two scenarios below:
1. The borrower must ﬁrst recover the following (which will result in a reduction in the
amount of appreciation) before the provider is able to share in appreciation:
any portion of the down payment that came from the borrower's own funds,
reasonable costs of selling the property (such as a sales commission),
Provider's share of appreciation
the costs of any improvements made by the borrower to the property (provided they
were allowed under the program's legal documentation and not otherwise taken into
account in determining the amount of appreciation), and
the principal portion of all payments the borrower made on the ﬁrst mortgage.
2. The provider may share in appreciation greater than the Standard Percentage if
in the ﬁrst year following origination of the shared appreciation loan, the share does not
initially exceed 75%, or
after the ﬁrst year following origination of the shared appreciation loan, the share is
reduced at least proportionally each year, so the share is equal to or less than the
Standard Percentage no later than ﬁve years following origination of the shared
appreciation loan.
For example, if the provider's share of appreciation is 70% in the ﬁrst year, and the
Standard Percentage is 10%, then the provider's share must decrease by at least 15%
annually (70% minus 10%, divided by 4), so that in the second, third, and fourth years, the
provider's share of appreciation must not exceed 55%, 40%, and 25%, respectively.
Delivery Requirements
Lenders must report SFC 176 when delivering a loan with shared appreciation.

(05/03/2023)
Introduction This topic contains general information on loans with resale restrictions, including:
Overview Allowable Resale Restrictions Duration of Resale Restrictions Title Insurance Requirements Default Remedies Rights to Insurance Settlements and Condemnation Proceeds
Overview
Resale restrictions are a right in perpetuity or for a certain number of years, stated in the form of a restriction, easement, covenant, or condition in any deed, mortgage, ground lease, agreement, or other instrument executed by or on behalf of the owner of the land. The resale restrictions may limit the occupancy of all or part of the land to individuals meeting certain conditions, such as age (senior communities must comply with applicable law). When resale restrictions are included in a mortgage, the terms must comply with this Guide.
Note: This topic does not pertain to loans that are part of shared equity transactions, which have resale restrictions that limit both income eligibility and impose a maximum resale price. See Section B5-5.3, Shared Equity Transactions for additional information.
Allowable Resale Restrictions
Fannie Mae will purchase loans that are subject to one or more of the following types of resale restrictions:
income limits, age-related requirements, employment-related requirements, occupancy requirements, ﬁrst-time homebuyer requirements, and restrictions on group homes or homes that are principally used to serve residents with disabilities.
Some restrictions are likely to occur only in combination with others and it is permissible for more than one
Published February 5, 2025
761
resale restriction to apply to a single loan.
Duration of Resale Restrictions
Fannie Mae will purchase loans secured by properties subject to resale restrictions in the following circumstances:
when the restrictions terminate automatically upon foreclosure (or the expiration of any applicable redemption period), upon the recordation of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or when the resale restrictions survive foreclosure.
Note: If the resale restrictions survive foreclosure, the lender represents and warrants that the resale restrictions do not impair the servicer's ability to foreclose on the restricted property.
There are no restrictions on the length of the period in which the resale restrictions may remain in place on the property.
Title Insurance Requirements
The source and terms of the resale restrictions must be included in the public land records so that they are readily identiﬁable in a routine title search.
Default Remedies
The presence of resale restrictions must not impair Fannie Mae's legal rights to cure a default under the loan terms, to foreclose on the subject property, or to otherwise protect Fannie Mae's interests under the mortgage.
Rights to Insurance Settlements and Condemnation Proceeds
Fannie Mae must have ﬁrst claim to insurance settlements and condemnation proceeds.

Introduction This topic contains information on loans with resale restrictions loan and borrower eligibility, collateral and delivery requirements including:
Eligibility Requirements Appraisal Requirements Pricing and Delivery Considerations
Eligibility Requirements
The following table describes the eligibility requirements for loans with resale restrictions.
Criteria
Requirements
Loan Eligibility
The loan must be a ﬁxed-rate or ARM with an initial ﬁxed period of ﬁve years or more
and must comply with this Guide.
Borrowers must meet applicable criteria of the deed restriction.
If income limit requirements are imposed by both the resale restrictions and the terms
of the mortgage, the most restrictive will apply.
Borrower Eligibility
Note: Age-related restrictions generally apply to the unit occupant and frequently
require only one occupant to be aged 55 and over. In such a case, the borrower could
be younger than 55 provided there is a unit occupant aged 55 and over. This
occupant can be a non-borrower household member or a renter in the case of an
investment property.
One- and two-unit properties are eligible, including PUDs, condos, and co-ops.
Property Type
Manufactured homes are not eligible unless they are located in a PERS-approved
project.
Appraisal Requirements
In cases where the resale restrictions terminate automatically upon foreclosure (or the expiration of any applicable redemption period), or upon recordation of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, the appraisal should reﬂect the market value of the property without resale restrictions.
The lender must ensure that the borrower and appraiser are aware of the resale restrictions and should advise the appraiser that they must include the following statement in the appraisal report:
Published February 5, 2025
763
"This appraisal is made on the basis of a hypothetical condition that the property rights being appraised are without resale and other restrictions that are terminated automatically upon the latter of foreclosure or the expiration of any applicable redemption period, or upon recordation of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure."
In cases where the resale restrictions survive foreclosure or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, the appraisal must reﬂect the impact the restrictions have on value and be supported by comparable sales with similar restrictions.
The appraisal report must note the existence of the resale restrictions and comment on any impact the resale restrictions have on the property's value and marketability.
Pricing and Delivery Considerations
Pricing
There are no speciﬁc LLPAs required for loans with resale restrictions. All other price adjustments that are otherwise applicable to the transaction will apply. For a list of current applicable LLPAs, see the Loan-Level Price Adjustment (LLPA) Matrix .
Special Feature Codes
Lenders must report SFC 631 when delivering a loan secured by a property with resale restrictions that survive foreclosure or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.
No special feature code is required when delivering a loan secured by a property with resale restrictions that terminate automatically upon foreclosure (or the expiration of any applicable redemption period), or the recordation of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure unless the loan is part of a shared equity transaction.

Introduction This topic contains information on shared equity transactions, including:
Overview Community Land Trusts Income and Resale Price Restrictions
Overview
Shared equity programs, sometimes called "below-market programs," create long-term aﬀordability by both limiting income eligibility and imposing a maximum resale price (or a resale formula applies that limits the homeowner's proceeds upon resale). Shared equity providers typically make a one-time investment in a property by subsidizing the sales price for the ﬁrst buyer and recycling the subsidy for subsequent, income- eligible buyers of the same property. In exchange for purchasing a home below market value, the homeowners agree to restrictions on the future sale of the home, including limitations on sales price or proceeds that maintain aﬀordability for the next buyer.
Loans originated in connection with the following shared equity programs are eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae:
community land trusts, income and resale price restrictions, limited or shared equity co-ops.
It is against Fannie Mae policy to compel borrowers to participate in arbitration to resolve disputes regarding their mortgage loan. See B8-3-02, Special Note Provisions and Language Requirements. Similarly, Fannie Mae will not purchase shared equity loans where the borrower is required to submit to arbitration to resolve disputes with the shared equity program unless the mandatory arbitration provision provides, or is amended to provide, that, in the event of a transfer or sale of the related mortgage or an interest in the related mortgage loan to Fannie Mae, the mandatory arbitration clause immediately and automatically becomes null and void and cannot be reinstated. This does not prohibit the borrower and the shared equity program from engaging voluntarily in arbitration, mediation, or other alternative methods of dispute resolution.
Note: This topic focuses on community land trusts and income and resale price restrictions. For information on limited or shared equity co-ops, see B4-2.1-03, Ineligible Projects.
Community Land Trusts
Community land trusts preserve long-term aﬀordable housing by purchasing homes in their communities, then selling the homes to income-eligible buyers while retaining ownership of the land. The homeowners lease the land from the community land trust using a long-term ground lease with aﬀordable monthly ground rents. The ground lease includes provisions that preserve long-term aﬀordability, including restrictions on the future sales
Published February 5, 2025
765
price of the home and income levels of future homeowners.
Income and Resale Price Restrictions
Resale restrictions are a right in perpetuity or for a certain number of years and are binding on current and future property owners. They remain in eﬀect until they are formally removed or modiﬁed, or terminate in accordance with their terms, such as at a foreclosure sale or upon acceptance of a deed-in-lieu.
Income and resale price restrictions help maintain long-term aﬀordability for shared equity programs. These programs include both an income and a maximum resale price restriction that eﬀectively subsidize the sales prices for income-eligible buyers, and in exchange for the subsidy, the buyers agree to resale restrictions that limit the future sales price of the home to preserve aﬀordability for future income-eligible buyers.
For information on other types of resale restrictions, see B5-5.2-01, Loans With Resale Restrictions: General Information and B5-5.2-02, Loans with Resale Restrictions: Eligibility, Collateral and Delivery Requirements.

Notiﬁcation to Third Parties
The terms of the shared equity legal agreement (as modiﬁed by a Community Land Trust Ground Rider, if applicable) may require the servicer to notify an interested third party, such as the shared equity provider or its designee, when the borrower defaults on the loan or in the event of foreclosure. In this case, the servicer must ensure proper notiﬁcation is provided, as required by the terms of the legal agreement.
Regardless of any third-party notiﬁcation requirements, the servicer is still responsible for adhering to Fannie Mae's established timeframes for completing routine foreclosure. Any third-party notiﬁcations required in addition to the required statutory notiﬁcations must not impair the servicer's ability to foreclose.

Aﬀordable LTV Calculation: Resale Restrictions that Terminate at Foreclosure
When resale restrictions terminate automatically upon foreclosure (or the expiration of any applicable redemption period), or the recordation of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, the sales price is typically not a reliable indicator of market value for the property because the sales price does not include the subsidy from the shared equity provider. The appraised value is more indicative of the actual value of the property in the event of a foreclosure or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure (disregarding factors that may aﬀect value after origination and prior to foreclosure). Accordingly, for these types of transactions, lenders must use the "Aﬀordable LTV" calculation to determine LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios.
The Aﬀordable LTV calculation divides the loan amount by the appraised value of the property, rather than the lesser of the sales price or the appraised value. The following table provides an example of the Aﬀordable LTV calculation method.
Item
Amount
Appraised value
$200,000
Shared equity program subsidy amount
$40,000
Subsidized sales price
$160,000
First mortgage loan amount
$160,000
Aﬀordable LTV Ratio (ﬁrst mortgage loan amount divided by the
appraised value)
80%
When using the Aﬀordable LTV calculation, the lender must
for DU loans, enter "Aﬀordable LTV" in the Product Description ﬁeld in the online application, which will result in DU calculating the LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios based solely on the appraised value for purchase transactions (and not the lesser of the sales price or appraised value); and for all loans, use the appraised value to determine
the minimum down payment; the borrower contribution, if applicable, that must be made from the borrower's own resources; and the level of mortgage insurance required.
LTV Calculation: Resale Restrictions that Survive Foreclosure
When resale restrictions survive foreclosure or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, the lender must use the lesser of the sales price or appraised value of the property with resale restrictions when calculating the LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios, which is the standard method of calculation. Fannie Mae requires use of the standard calculation on the lower value due to the presence of resale restrictions, which limit the property's sales price in the event

of foreclosure or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.
Note: This does not apply to loans secured by community land trust properties, which require the resale restrictions to terminate automatically upon foreclosure (or the expiration of any applicable redemption period), or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.
Appraisal Requirements
For properties in a community land trust, the appraisal requirements can be found in B4-1.4-06, Community Land Trust Appraisal Requirements.
For properties with income and resale price restrictions, the following requirements apply:
In cases where the resale restrictions terminate automatically upon foreclosure (or the expiration of any applicable redemption period), or upon recordation of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, the appraisal should reﬂect the market value of the property without resale restrictions. The lender must ensure that the borrower and appraiser are aware of the resale restrictions and should advise the appraiser that they must include the following statement in the appraisal report:
"This appraisal is made on the basis of a hypothetical condition that the property rights being appraised are without resale and other restrictions that are terminated automatically upon the latter of foreclosure or the expiration of any applicable redemption period, or upon recordation of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure."
In cases where the resale restrictions survive foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, the appraisal must reﬂect the impact the restrictions have on value and be supported by comparable sales with similar restrictions. The appraisal report must note the existence of the resale restrictions and comment on any impact the resale restrictions have on the property's value and marketability.

Lender Eligibility Loan Eligibility Requirements Legal Considerations
Lender Eligibility
Fannie Mae may purchase loans in Massachusetts that are subject to the Aﬀordable Housing Restriction document without further approval from Fannie Mae. This includes any federal, state, or local subsidy program for properties located in Massachusetts.
Use of the Aﬀordable Housing Restriction document (copies of which can be obtained from the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency) without modiﬁcation, alteration or update, other than ﬁlling in the blanks or checking boxes contained in the form, eliminates the need for the lender to review the terms and conditions of the particular subsidy program with respect to loans delivered to Fannie Mae secured by properties in Massachusetts that are subject to resale restriction(s).
Loan Eligibility Requirements
Published February 5, 2025
775
The Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency requires the use of an Aﬀordable Housing Restriction document in connection with loans secured by properties in Massachusetts that are subject to resale restrictions that survive foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in which it will serve as lender or project administrator.
Legal Considerations
The Aﬀordable Housing Restriction document provides for third-party modiﬁcation by the foreclosing servicer and provides for a 120-day time period between notiﬁcation of foreclosure to the municipality by the foreclosing servicer and the completion of the repurchase of the property by the municipality.
While Fannie Mae's standard guidelines require a 90-day time period for notiﬁcation, use of this instrument for loans subject to a resale restriction secured by property in Massachusetts is acceptable without further approval from Fannie Mae.
All other applicable requirements for resale restrictions continue to apply.

Overview
The HomeReady mortgage is a conventional community lending mortgage that oﬀers underwriting ﬂexibilities to qualiﬁed borrowers who meet speciﬁc income criteria. The HomeReady mortgage is a standard product oﬀering available to all Fannie Mae lenders. No special approvals are required.
General Loan Eligibility
A HomeReady mortgage is a ﬁrst mortgage, purchase money, or limited cash-out reﬁnance transaction for one- to four-unit properties used as the borrower’s principal residence.
Eligible properties include:
one-unit properties, including manufactured housing, and units in condos and PUDs;
units in co-ops, provided the unit conforms to Fannie Mae's requirements, and the lender has received speciﬁc authority to deliver mortgages on co-ops to Fannie Mae;
existing structures and new construction; and
two-, three-, and four-unit properties.
Additional restrictions apply to transactions with LTV, CLTV, or HCLTV ratios of 95.01 — 97%. See below for additional requirements for HomeReady mortgage transactions.
Maximum LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV Ratios
Refer to the Eligibility Matrix for maximum allowable LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios for HomeReady mortgage loans. HomeReady loans that are originated in connection with manufactured homes must follow the more restrictive LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios that apply. For example, the maximum LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratio for a one-unit HomeReady manufactured home that does not meet the MH Advantage requirements is 95%.
Requirements for HomeReady Transactions with LTV, CLTV, or HCLTV Ratios of 95.01 – 97%
If the LTV, CLTV, or HCLTV ratio exceeds 95% for a HomeReady transaction, the following requirements apply.

Loans must be purchase transactions.
Loans must be ﬁxed-rate or seven- or ten-year ARMs.
All other standard buydown policies apply.
See B2-1.4-04, Temporary Interest Rate Buydowns, for additional information.
Borrower Income Limits and Calculations
In determining whether a mortgage is eligible under the borrower income limits, the lender must count the income from all borrowers who will sign the note, to the extent that the income is considered in evaluating creditworthiness for the loan.
The lender must use the same methodology in determining income eligibility for a HomeReady mortgage as the lender uses in reporting “Monthly Income” in data delivery. Eligibility for a HomeReady mortgage loan compares the borrower’s income to the applicable area median income (AMI) for the property’s location. For determining
Published February 5, 2025
779
Fannie Mae loan eligibility, lenders must refer to the AMIs that Fannie Mae uses in Desktop Underwriter or on Fannie Mae’s website and may not rely on other published versions (such as AMIs posted on huduser.org).
To be eligible as a HomeReady mortgage, the total annual qualifying income may not exceed 80% of the AMI for the property’s location. If the property has resale restrictions, see B5-5.2-02, Loans with Resale Restrictions: Eligibility, Collateral and Delivery Requirements, for additional requirements.
Note: For loan caseﬁles that are not underwritten as a HomeReady mortgage loan, DU will issue a message indicating that the loan may be eligible as a HomeReady loan if the total qualifying income entered in DU appears to be within the applicable AMI limit for the property’s location. See B5-6-02, HomeReady Mortgage Underwriting Methods and Requirements, for additional information.
Homeownership Education and Housing Counseling
Homeownership education is required for HomeReady purchase loans when all occupying borrowers are ﬁrst- time homebuyers. Borrowers who complete housing counseling within 12 months prior to loan closing may be eligible for a loan-level price adjustment credit. Refer to B2-2-06, Homeownership Education and Housing Counseling, for options for meeting these requirements.

Requirements (06/05/2024)
Introduction This topic contains information about HomeReady mortgage loans, including:
Underwriting Options Minimum Borrower Contribution for Purchase Transactions Non-Occupant Borrowers Rental Income from the Subject Property Boarder Income Cash-on-Hand Sweat Equity Minimum Reserve Requirements Multiple Financed Properties Borrowers with Low Credit Scores: Manual Underwriting Only
Underwriting Options
HomeReady mortgage loans can be underwritten with DU or may be manually underwritten. The maximum LTV ratio is lower for manually underwritten transactions versus those underwritten in DU (95% versus 97% for one- unit principal residences). As a reminder, the limited waiver of representations and warranties typically granted for loans underwritten with DU does not apply to manually underwritten loans.
For HomeReady mortgage loans that are underwritten through DU, the lender must enter data in the online loan application, identify the loan as a community lending mortgage, and select the HomeReady product.
If the lender does not select HomeReady as the community lending product, DU will provide a message when the total qualifying income entered in DU appears to be within the applicable AMI limits for the property’s location. The lender must then select the HomeReady product and resubmit the loan caseﬁle to help determine if the loan meets all of the HomeReady requirements (assuming the lender wants to sell the loan to Fannie Mae as a HomeReady mortgage).

Note: If a grant or lender-funded grant is being provided, see B3-4.3-06, Grants and Lender Contributions for additional borrower contribution requirements.
No minimum contribution is required in connection with a limited cash-out reﬁnance transaction.
Non-Occupant Borrowers
Non-occupant borrowers are permitted on HomeReady mortgages. See B2-2-04, Guarantors, Co-Signers, or Non- Occupant Borrowers on the Subject Transaction, for the eligibility requirements that apply.
Rental Income from the Subject Property
Rental income is an acceptable source of qualifying income in the following instances:
one-unit principal residence with an accessory unit. See B4-1.3-05, Improvements Section of the Appraisal Report, for additional details related to acceptable accessory units;
two- to four-unit principal residence properties.
See B3-3.1-08, Rental Income, for calculation and documentation of rental income used for qualifying purposes.
Boarder Income
The rental payments that any borrower receives from one or more individuals who reside with the borrower (who may or may not be related to the borrower) may be considered as acceptable stable income. This applies for a one-unit property in an amount up to 30% of the total gross income that is used to qualify the borrower for the mortgage if the boarder
is not obligated on the mortgage loan and does not have an ownership interest in the property;
has lived with the borrower for the last 12 months;
can provide appropriate documentation to demonstrate a history of shared residency (such as a copy of a driver’s license, bill, or bank statement that shows the boarder’s address as being the same as the borrower’s address); and
Published February 5, 2025
782
can demonstrate the payment of rental payments (such as with copies of canceled checks) to the borrower for
the last 12 months, or
at least 9 of the most recent 12 months provided the rental income is averaged over a 12–month period.
Payment of rent by the boarder directly to a third party is not acceptable.
Cash-on-Hand
Lenders may deliver purchase money mortgages for one-unit properties with cash-on-hand as an acceptable source of funds for the borrower’s down payment, funds for closing costs, and prepaid items.
Note: Cash-on-hand may not be used to fund the borrower’s reserve requirement, if applicable.
The lender must verify and document the following with respect to the cash-on-hand funds:
The borrower customarily uses cash for expenses, and the amount of funds saved is consistent with the borrower’s previous payment practices.
The lender must verify that funds for the down payment and closing costs exist in a ﬁnancial institution account or an acceptable escrow account. Funds must be on deposit at the time of application, or no less than 30 days prior to closing.
The lender must obtain a written statement from the borrower that discloses the source of funds and states that the funds have not been borrowed.
The borrower’s credit report and other veriﬁcations should indicate limited or no use of credit and limited or no depository relationship between the borrower and a ﬁnancial institution.
Sweat Equity
Fannie Mae considers sweat equity an acceptable source of funds for HomeReady loans when the borrower participates in an aﬀordable housing purchase program run by an eligible provider. Sweat equity program providers must be a nonproﬁt organization exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the IRS code with a demonstrated history of aﬀordable housing construction and experience in managing volunteers.
Sweat equity can only be applied towards the down payment, and the borrower must comply with the requirements in Minimum Borrower Contribution for Purchase Transactions.
The following table provides the maximum sweat equity amount and LTV ratio requirements based on property type.

The lender must document the loan is originated under a speciﬁc lending program. The value attributed to sweat equity must be based on the hours of work performed. The following table provides instructions for determining the contributory value of sweat equity.
Step
Determining the Value of Sweat Equity
The hours of work to be performed and the hourly rate established by the sweat equity program
1.
provider must be fully documented in an agreement between the borrower and the provider.
The hourly rate must conform with the national or state value of volunteer time per hour.
The hours of work performed each day must be recorded in a log managed by the sweat equity
program provider.
The log must include all of the following:
program name,
borrower name,
2.
work date(s),
time in/out,
number of hours,
volunteer worker name,
work location and activity, and
supervisory approval.
Note: The hours of work performed must be completed before the loan is closed.
The contributory value of the sweat equity is calculated by multiplying the total number of hours
3.
of work performed by the hourly rate.
Example:
500 hours worked x $20 per hour = $10,000
The lender must review the agreement and log from the sweat equity program provider to
4.
validate the contributory value of the sweat equity applied towards the down payment.
All documentation must be retained in the loan ﬁle.
Minimum Reserve Requirements
For manually underwritten loans, the reserve requirements are documented in the Eligibility Matrix. For DU loan
Published February 5, 2025
784
caseﬁles, DU will determine the reserve requirement.
Multiple Financed Properties
The occupant borrower may not have more than two ﬁnanced properties. See B2-2-03, Multiple Financed Properties for the Same Borrower, for the requirements.
Borrowers with Low Credit Scores: Manual Underwriting Only
For HomeReady mortgage loans secured by one-unit properties, if the loan-level credit score is less than the minimum credit score required for a HomeReady mortgage, the loan may still be eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae if the following requirements are met:
The credit report indicates that the borrower’s credit score is low due to an insuﬃcient traditional credit history (as documented by reason codes on the credit report that indicate a lack of credit accounts, accounts not opened long enough, lack of usage, etc., as reasons for the low credit score). If the borrower’s credit score is low due to derogatory credit or if none of the reason codes noted above appear on the credit report, then the minimum credit score for the transaction must be met (per the Eligibility Matrix).
The lender must supplement the traditional credit ﬁle (referred to as a “thin ﬁle”) with the development of an acceptable nontraditional credit proﬁle in accordance with Section B3–5.4, Nontraditional Credit History.
The lender must deliver the borrower’s credit score (even if below the minimum required) along with SFC 818 at loan delivery to identify HomeReady mortgage loans that have borrowers with thin ﬁles.
Note: Special Feature Code 818 should only be used to indicate a “thin ﬁle” HomeReady mortgage loan.

Eligible Subordinate Financing Leasehold Estates Eligibility Multiple Financed Properties
Overview
The high LTV reﬁnance option is designed for Fannie Mae borrowers who are making their mortgage payments on time, but whose LTV ratios exceed the maximum allowed for standard limited cash-out reﬁnance transactions. Lenders are not required to evaluate borrower creditworthiness except for the requirements speciﬁcally stated in the high LTV reﬁnance topics.
The current servicer or a new servicer may reﬁnance the existing loan. Lenders may not solicit Fannie Mae loans for reﬁnancing except in accordance with standard requirements in Lender Solicitation for Reﬁnancing found in B2-1.3-04, Prohibited Reﬁnancing Practices.
Note: The acquisition of high LTV reﬁnances is currently paused.
Existing Loan Requirements
The following table provides requirements for the existing loan that is to be reﬁnanced under the high LTV reﬁnance option.
✓
The existing loan must....
be a ﬁrst lien, conventional mortgage loan owned or securitized by Fannie Mae.
have a note date on or after October 1, 2017.
have seasoning of at least 15 months - meaning at least 15 months have passed from the note
date of the existing loan to the note date of the new loan.
For example, if the note date on the existing loan is January 1, 2018, the note date of the new
loan must be no earlier than April 1, 2019.
Note: Loans that are part of a risk-sharing structure (for example, credit risk transfers) are eligible to be reﬁnanced under the high LTV reﬁnance option.
Conversely, the following loans are not eligible for reﬁnance under the high LTV reﬁnance option:
existing DU Reﬁ PlusTM or Reﬁ PlusTM loans;
loans that are subject to outstanding repurchase demands; or
loans that are subject to recourse, repurchase agreement, indemniﬁcation, or another negotiated credit enhancement required at origination for eligibility purposes are not eligible unless

such credit enhancement is not required for eligibility purposes on the new loan.
New Loan Requirements
The following table provides requirements for the new loan resulting from the reﬁnance under the high LTV reﬁnance option.
✓
The new loan must...
have an application date on or after November 1, 2018.
Note: The acquisition of high LTV reﬁnances is currently paused.
be either:
a ﬁxed-rate loan; or
an ARM that reﬁnances an existing ARM, with the new ARM having a minimum ﬁve-year ﬁxed
rate term.
have a term not to exceed 30 years.
meet current general or high-balance loan limits, as applicable, at the time of loan delivery.
have a newly executed Uniform Residential Loan Application (Form 1003) for the borrower(s)
with all information completed, including borrower income, employment, and assets.
provide a beneﬁt to the borrower in the form of at least one of the following:
a lower P&I payment;
a lower interest rate;
a shorter amortization term; or
movement to a more stable product (for example, from an ARM or step-rate modiﬁcation to a
ﬁxed-rate loan).
The new loan cannot be originated pursuant to Texas Constitution Section 50(a)(6). Temporary interest rate buydowns are not allowed.
The standard limited cash-out reﬁnance requirements are modiﬁed for high LTV loan transactions. The new loan amount is limited to
the payoﬀ of the UPB of the existing ﬁrst mortgage loan being reﬁnanced (including accrued interest);
the ﬁnancing of closing costs, prepaid items, and points up to $5,000 total for the new loan; and
cash back to the borrower up to $250. Excess proceeds may be applied as a curtailment on the new loan.
Published February 5, 2025
789
Lenders may provide an incentive to the borrower(s) in the form of a payment to pay oﬀ a portion of the existing loan being reﬁnanced provided the following:
no repayment is required,
the payment is reﬂected on the settlement statement as a lender credit, and
because any such reduction of the existing loan balance will impact the LTV ratio as it applies to the calculation of the new loan amount, lenders are advised to use caution as incentives have the potential to reduce the LTV ratio below the minimum allowed for this option.
See B3-4.1-02, Interested Party Contributions (IPCs), for additional requirements that apply to lender incentives.
Borrower Eligibility
Generally, the borrower(s) on the loan being reﬁnanced (or the current borrower(s) if the existing loan was assumed) must be identical to the borrower(s) on the new loan. However, an existing borrower may be excluded from the new loan for either of the following:
the remaining borrower(s) meets the mortgage payment history requirements and provides evidence that they have been making the payments on the existing loan from their own funds for the most recent 12 months prior to the application of the new loan, or
due to the death of a borrower. Evidence of the deceased borrower’s death must be documented in the loan ﬁle.
If this criteria cannot be met, the new loan must be underwritten in accordance with the Alternative Qualiﬁcation Path. See B5-7-03, High LTV Reﬁnance Alternative Qualiﬁcation Path for additional information.
New borrowers may not be added to the new loan reﬁnanced via the high LTV reﬁnance option. Additionally, if the loan being reﬁnanced was assumed by the current borrower(s) prior to the reﬁnance, the current borrowers must have been qualiﬁed for the existing loan in accordance with the requirements of the Servicing Guide.
Borrowers who have applied for or received a modiﬁcation are eligible for reﬁnancing provided the following:
the borrower beneﬁt provision is met using the prevailing payment, and
the payment history requirement is met. See Credit Eligibility Requirements in B5-7-02, High LTV Reﬁnance Underwriting, Documentation, and Collateral Requirements for the New Loan.
Property Eligibility
All Fannie Mae-eligible property types are permitted for reﬁnance under the high LTV reﬁnance option.
For properties in condo, co-op, or PUD projects, all project review requirements are waived with the exception that the lender must conﬁrm the project is not a condo or co-op hotel or motel, houseboat project, timeshare, or segmented ownership project. For assistance in determining whether the project is a condo or co-op hotel or motel, see B4-2.1-03, Ineligible Projects.
The lender must obtain property and ﬂood insurance in accordance with this Guide.

The loan being reﬁnanced and the new loan do not have to represent the same occupancy. The occupancy of the subject property may have changed by the time of the high LTV reﬁnance transaction.
There are no maximum LTV, CLTV, or HCLTV ratios for ﬁxed-rate loans. There is a maximum LTV ratio of 105% for ARM loans, but no maximum CLTV or HCLTV ratio. For comprehensive requirements see the Eligibility Matrix .
Eligible Subordinate Financing
New subordinate ﬁnancing is only permitted if it replaces existing subordinate ﬁnancing. In addition, the existing subordinate ﬁnancing
may not be satisﬁed with the proceeds of the new loan, but
may remain in place as long as it is resubordinated to the new loan, and
may be simultaneously reﬁnanced as long as the new subordinate lien loan amount does not exceed the existing UPB.
Other subordinate ﬁnancing requirements described in B2-1.2-04, Subordinate Financing are not applicable.
Note: Although standard Fannie Mae policy prohibits subordinate ﬁnancing on co-op share loans, an exception is permitted for high LTV reﬁnance loans as long as the existing subordinate lien is subordinate to the new co-op share loans.
Leasehold Estates Eligibility
Published February 5, 2025
791
The term of the leasehold must run for at least ﬁve years beyond the maturity date of the mortgage, unless fee simple title will vest at an earlier date in the borrower. The lender is not required to perform any additional review of the leasehold terms.
Multiple Financed Properties
There are no limits on the number of ﬁnanced properties the borrower may own. The additional eligibility requirements for borrowers with multiple ﬁnanced properties in B2-2-03, Multiple Financed Properties for the Same Borrower do not apply.

B5-7-02, High LTV Reﬁnance Underwriting, Documentation, and
Collateral Requirements for the New Loan (03/01/2023)
Introduction This topic contains information about underwriting requirements for the high LTV reﬁnance option, including:
Underwriting Methods Underwriting Requirements Employment, Income, and Asset Veriﬁcation Valuation Requirements
Underwriting Methods
High LTV reﬁnance loans may be underwritten using DU or manually, with the exception of loans subject to the Alternative Qualiﬁcation Path (which must be manually underwritten). Loans secured by a second home or an investment property must be underwritten in DU and receive an Approve/Eligible recommendation, unless they are required to be underwritten in accordance with the Alternative Qualiﬁcation Path (see B5-7-03, High LTV Reﬁnance Alternative Qualiﬁcation Path).
Loans Underwritten in DU
When a limited cash-out reﬁnance loan caseﬁle that meets the minimum LTV requirement for a high LTV reﬁnance loan is underwritten in DU, internal data will be used to determine if Fannie Mae owns the loan on the
Published February 5, 2025
792
property, and if that loan is eligible to be reﬁnanced using the high LTV reﬁnance option.
When DU ﬁnds a loan for the subject property address using either the address provided on the DU loan application or the standardized address, DU will then conﬁrm that the Social Security number(s) for the borrower(s) on the new loan caseﬁle match those on the existing loan. The result of the Social Security number matching will be speciﬁed in a DU message.
When none of the borrower Social Security numbers match, the loan caseﬁle will not be underwritten as a high LTV reﬁnance loan. DU will issue a message informing the lender that the Social Security number(s) does not match and remind the lender to conﬁrm the property address.
When there is a Social Security number match, DU will underwrite the loan caseﬁle as a high LTV reﬁnance loan. If the Social Security number for any of the borrowers on the loan caseﬁle do not match using all nine digits, DU will advise the lender.
When a borrower Social Security number is matched using 7 or 8 digits of the 9-digit Social Security number, the DU message will specify that the Social Security numbers are one or two digits diﬀerent and will require the lender to conﬁrm the borrowers on the existing loan are the same borrowers that will be on the new loan.
When there are two borrowers on the new loan and two borrowers on the existing loan, but only one borrower’s Social Security number matches, the DU message will specify that not all of the borrower Social Security numbers match and will require that the lender conﬁrm the borrowers on the existing loan are the same borrowers that will be on the new loan.
When one borrower is on the new loan caseﬁle but more than one borrower is on the existing loan, the DU message will state that it appears that a borrower is being removed with transaction and refer the lender to the Selling Guide for additional requirements on removing a borrower with a high LTV reﬁnance transaction.
When there is more than one borrower on the new loan caseﬁle but there is only one on the existing loan, the DU message will state that it appears that a borrower is being added with the high LTV reﬁnance transaction, and if that is the case, the high LTV reﬁnance loan is not eligible for delivery.
Manually Underwritten Loans
The lender must determine that all eligibility requirements are met for manually underwritten loans.
Underwriting Requirements

Published February 5, 2025
To be eligible for the high LTV reﬁnance option, the
payment history for the existing loan for the most recent
12 months must reﬂect
no delinquencies in the most recent 6 months, and
in months 7-12, no more than one, 30-day delinquency
and no delinquency greater than 30 days.
There are no maximum DTI ratio requirements except for
loans underwritten under the Alternative Qualiﬁcation
Path.
There is no minimum credit score requirement except for
loans underwritten under the Alternative Qualiﬁcation
Path.
Lenders must obtain and review a merged credit report in
accordance with standard Selling Guide policies for
payment history and pricing purposes. However, lenders
are not required to comply with the waiting period and re-
establishment of credit requirements for signiﬁcant
derogatory credit events or the payoﬀ or satisfaction of a
judgment identiﬁed on the credit report. Also, lenders are
not required to review or consider Form 1003
Declarations in the underwriting evaluation.
The lender does not need to conﬁrm the subject property

Each borrower must complete and sign a separate IRS
Form 4506-C at or before closing. See B3-3.1-06,
Requirements and Uses of IRS IVES Request for Transcript
of Tax Return Form 4506-C, for additional information.
794
If the loan is a higher-priced mortgage loan or a higher-
priced covered transaction under Regulation Z, the loan
must comply with the Alternative Qualiﬁcation Path
requirements. DU is unable to determine if a loan caseﬁle
is a higher-priced mortgage loan or a higher-priced
Higher-Priced Loan Requirements
covered transaction under Regulation Z. The lender must
make this determination. Lenders are not relieved of
complying with Regulation Z by only adhering to the
stricter representative credit score and DTI ratio. The loan
must comply in all respects with Regulation Z
requirements for such loans, including the underwriting
and consumer protection requirements.
Employment, Income, and Asset Veriﬁcation
The lender must obtain one of the following for the new loan:
a verbal veriﬁcation of employment for employment or self-employment income for at least one borrower,
documentation of a non-employment income source, or
documentation of liquid ﬁnancial reserves equal to 12 months of the new monthly housing payment.
With the exception of loans underwritten under the Alternative Qualiﬁcation Path, lenders are not required to
assess continuity of income,
verify income,
verify assets, or
calculate the DTI ratio.
Valuation Requirements
For certain loan caseﬁles, DU will oﬀer value acceptance (appraisal waiver) or value acceptance + property data - options to sell the loan to Fannie Mae without an appraisal. Otherwise, an appraisal with an interior and exterior inspection is required. If an appraisal is obtained, it must be used for valuation even if a waiver is oﬀered by DU.
A lender may only exercise the high LTV reﬁnance value acceptance (appraisal waiver) or value acceptance + property data oﬀer if
the ﬁnal submission of the loan caseﬁle to DU resulted in an oﬀer,
an appraisal is not obtained for the transaction, and
Published February 5, 2025
795
the oﬀer is not more than four months old on the date of the note and the mortgage.
Lenders exercising the high LTV reﬁnance value acceptance (appraisal waiver) must deliver Special Feature Code 807 or 774 for value acceptance + property data.
When the lender is required by law to obtain an appraisal, the lender must comply with such requirements, but may still exercise the oﬀer.
For manually underwritten loans, an appraisal with an interior and exterior inspection is required.
Repairs to a property damaged as the result of a disaster (as deﬁned by this Selling Guide) are not required prior to loan sale as long as the loan meets the applicable property insurance requirements. The lender is not required to perform an additional inspection and/or new appraisal of the property after a disaster.

Introduction This topic contains information about the representations and warranties for the high LTV reﬁnance option, including:
Lender Representations and Warranties Applicability of the Representation and Warranty Framework
Lender Representations and Warranties
For high LTV reﬁnance loans, lenders are responsible for the standard representations and warranties described in the Selling Guide, with a number of exceptions as noted below.
For all High LTV Reﬁnances
If the lender obtains an appraisal for the subject property, the lender is not responsible for the standard representations and warranties related to the marketability and condition of the property as reﬂected in the property valuation. The lender remains responsible for the appraisal as it pertains to the value.
Lenders may deliver loans on properties with a condition rating of C6 and/or a quality rating of Q6 completed on an “as-is” basis. There is no requirement for the appraisal to be completed “subject to” repairs being made.
For properties in a project, the lender is not responsible for the standard representations and warranties related to project eligibility. However, the lender must represent and warrant the property is not a condo or co-op hotel or motel, houseboat project, or a timeshare or segmented ownership project.
Loans Underwritten in DU
The lender is not responsible for any of the representations and warranties associated with the loan being reﬁnanced.
The lender is relieved of the standard underwriting representations and warranties (eligibility, credit history, liabilities, income and asset assessment) with respect to the new mortgage loan if the lender meets all of the following requirements:
All data in the loan caseﬁle is complete, accurate, and not fraudulent.
The lender follows the instructions in the DU Underwriting Findings report regarding income, employment, asset, and ﬁeldwork documentation.
The lender complies with all other requirements described in A2-2-04, Limited Waiver and Enforcement Relief of Representations and Warranties
The lender complies with the requirements described in A2-2-06, Representations and Warranties on Property Value.
Published February 5, 2025
801
Manually Underwritten Loans
The lender is not responsible for any of the representations and warranties associated with the loan being reﬁnanced other than those related to eligibility of the existing loan being reﬁnanced.
The lender must represent and warrant that the new loan meets all the requirements of the high LTV reﬁnance option as described in this Guide.
Applicability of the Representation and Warranty Framework
High LTV reﬁnance loans are eligible for enforcement relief in accordance with the requirements of A2-3.2-02, Enforcement Relief for Breaches of Certain Representations and Warranties Related to Underwriting and Eligibility.

the existing mortgage insurance coverage must be

To accomplish this, the mortgage insurer will modify
has existing mortgage insurance
the existing MI certiﬁcate and transfer it to the new
loan. Such transfer may or may not include assignment
of a new MI certiﬁcate number. Lenders should check
with the mortgage insurer for speciﬁc requirements.
Existing loans with ﬁnanced mortgage insurance are eligible for high LTV reﬁnance loans. There should be no diﬀerence in how coverage is continued on the reﬁnance of such loans versus existing loans that do not have ﬁnanced mortgage insurance. The existing coverage can be continued on the new loan regardless of whether the ﬁnanced premium on the existing loan was paid as a single premium or a split premium.
Mortgage insurance coverage must extend for the life of the new loan, or until cancellation or termination of coverage as required by law or Fannie Mae guidelines. For example, even if a 15-year loan that is 3 years old is reﬁnanced into a 30-year loan, the mortgage insurance coverage should be extended for the full life of the new loan.
A mortgage insurance company may charge a reasonable fee to transfer the certiﬁcate. Fannie Mae allows such cost to be rolled into the UPB of the new loan as a closing cost as long as the loan will still comply with both Fannie Mae and mortgage insurer guidelines. See B7-1-02, Mortgage Insurance Coverage Requirements for additional information.
Loan Delivery Requirements
For high LTV reﬁnance loans, lenders must provide all applicable loan delivery data elements and special feature codes.
The following special feature codes (SFC) may apply:
SFC 839 may optionally be delivered for high LTV reﬁnance loans underwritten using the standard requirements.
SFC 840 is required for high LTV reﬁnance loans that are underwritten using the Alternative Qualiﬁcation Path.
These codes are to be used in addition to any other special feature codes that may apply.
Income must be reported to Fannie Mae for all high LTV reﬁnance loans at the time of loan delivery even for
Published February 5, 2025
803
those transactions where there is no maximum DTI ratio. For high LTV reﬁnance loans with payment changes less than or equal to 20%, the lender must report the stated income on the loan application (if any). If the borrower does not state any income and the lender uses the veriﬁcation of reserves option as the income source, the lender must deliver the equivalent of the new monthly payment (PITIA) as the “Monthly Income” data element (Sort ID 291).
Note: Lenders must report gross monthly rent in the loan delivery data for all investment properties and two- to four- unit principal residence properties, regardless of whether the borrower is using rental income to qualify for the mortgage loan. See A3-4-02, Data Quality and Integrity for additional information.
Whole Loan Committing and Pooling of Loans with LTV Ratios Above 105%
Separate committing is required for high LTV reﬁnance loans with LTV ratios above 105%. These loans may not be delivered against standard whole loan commitments. Speciﬁc “High LTV Reﬁ” products are available in Fannie Mae’s whole loan committing application.
High LTV reﬁnance loans with LTV ratios above 105% cannot be included in TBA-eligible MBS, but must be included in pools speciﬁcally created for loans with LTV ratios above 105%.
Furthermore, lenders may be able to deliver high LTV reﬁnance loans with LTV ratios above 105% into the respective Fannie Majors pool speciﬁcally available for these loans. Due to the separate pool preﬁxes required for loans with LTV ratios above 105%, these loans may not be delivered into standard TBA-eligible Fannie Majors pools. However, MBS deliveries of loans reﬁnanced under this new option are eligible for securitization utilizing existing Fannie Mae pool preﬁxes.

Overview Lender Eligibility Mortgage Term Age of Loans Lien Requirements Rental Property Leases Mortgages Permitting Open-End Advances Mortgage Payments Notice of Transfer MBS Pool Parameters Remittance Types Credit Score Delivery of Government Mortgage Loans Loan Guaranty or Insurance
Overview
All eligible government mortgage loans purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae must comply with the requirements of the respective government agency. Those loans must also comply with Fannie Mae requirements for government mortgage loans as speciﬁcally addressed in this Selling Guide.
Lender Eligibility
Most government mortgage loans can only be delivered to Fannie Mae under a variance in the Lender Contract.
Mortgage Term
The term of a government mortgage loan may not extend more than 30 years beyond the date of the ﬁrst monthly payment.
Published February 5, 2025
805
Age of Loans
All government mortgage loans must be no more than six months old measured from the ﬁrst payment date to the "Purchase Ready" date (whole loan) or the MBS pool issue date (MBS loan).
Lien Requirements
The security instrument for a government mortgage loan must be a ﬁrst lien on the borrower’s real property. The security property may be subject only to liens for taxes and special assessments that are not yet due and payable and to conditions, restrictions, and encumbrances that Fannie Mae does not consider as material. The lender must provide documentation to show that the current installments of taxes and assessments (including those that may have been attached as prior liens, but are not now in arrears) have been paid or that suﬃcient deposits are being collected to pay them.
Rental Property Leases
When the property that secures the mortgage is rented, the rental agreement or lease may not include any provision that could aﬀect signiﬁcantly Fannie Mae’s position as mortgagee. In some jurisdictions, leases that predate the mortgage have a superior claim to the mortgage even if they have not been recorded. Normally, a tenant’s rights under a pre-existing lease remain intact on the sale of the leased premises. Accordingly, if the lease is not subordinate to the mortgage, the lender must review each lease to ensure that any tenant’s rights to purchase the property, and any other rights that could aﬀect adversely the mortgagee’s interest, have been waived formally by the tenant or tenants.
Mortgages Permitting Open-End Advances
Fannie Mae will purchase or securitize a government mortgage loan that includes an open-end advance provision only if the provision gives Fannie Mae the option not to make any advances. If funds were advanced prior to delivery, the transaction is considered a modiﬁed mortgage that is not eligible for delivery. See B2-1.5-02, Loan Eligibility.
Mortgage Payments
Because Fannie Mae will not decline delivery submissions for slight diﬀerences in payment calculations, the lender may use any widely accepted amortization table or formula. However, the monthly payment provided as part of the delivery data and the one that Fannie Mae calculates cannot diﬀer by more than $1.00.
Notice of Transfer
When lenders deliver government mortgage loans to Fannie Mae for purchase or securitization, they must report the transfer of the loan in accordance with the applicable agency’s requirements, if applicable.
Published February 5, 2025
806
MBS Pool Parameters
Government mortgage loans (for example, FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed, HUD-guaranteed, and RD-guaranteed) that are securitized must be pooled in government-preﬁx MBS pools. Government mortgage loans cannot be commingled in the same pool with conventional mortgage loans.
Remittance Types
For all government mortgage loans, the actual/actual remittance type is required for whole loans. The scheduled/scheduled remittance type is required for all government mortgage loans delivered into MBS. (Lenders should refer to Fannie Mae’s whole loan committing application for additional information regarding eligible whole loan remittance types.)
Credit Score
All government mortgage loans are subject to a minimum representative credit score of 620. Manually underwritten government mortgage loans with nontraditional credit are exempt from this policy.
Delivery of Government Mortgage Loans
For government mortgage loans, the lender must report all applicable data elements at delivery, including but not limited to, the Section of the Act and certain government loan-speciﬁc special feature codes. Refer to the Fannie Mae Implementation Guide for Loan Delivery Data on Fannie Mae's website for additional information.
Loan Guaranty or Insurance

Introduction This topic contains information on mortgage insurance, including:
General Requirements Use of Approved Forms LTV Ratio Determination in New York State Payment of Mortgage Insurance Premiums Mortgage Insurability Prohibition of Certain Mortgage Insurance Agreements
General Requirements
Lenders must ensure that any mortgage insurance Fannie Mae requires for a mortgage loan is in place. Lenders must obtain and be able to produce evidence of any required mortgage insurance or loan guaranty.
Unless the lender has provided another charter-compliant form of credit enhancement, the lender must obtain a primary mortgage insurance policy for a conventional ﬁrst mortgage loan that has an LTV ratio greater than 80% at the time it is purchased for Fannie Mae’s portfolio or securitized. (For this purpose, the LTV ratio is calculated based upon the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loan at the time it is purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae.)
For a purchase money loan, the value used in determining the LTV ratio is the lower of the sales price or the appraised value of the security property.
For a reﬁnance loan, the value used in originating the loan can be derived from an appraisal, AVM, or other acceptable method.
Conventional mortgages may be insured by private mortgage insurers or state or local insuring agencies that have been approved under Fannie Mae’s Qualiﬁed Mortgage Insurer Approval Requirements to insure loans sold to or serviced for Fannie Mae. For a listing of the eligible conventional mortgage insurers and their associated mortgage insurance codes, see Approved Mortgage Insurers and Related Identiﬁers. The website is the deﬁnitive source for approved mortgage insurers.
The form of mortgage insurance policy, including any endorsements, must be acceptable to Fannie Mae.
Use of Approved Forms
Published February 5, 2025
814
Lenders are responsible for ensuring that only Fannie Mae-approved mortgage insurance forms and related endorsements and other forms (Forms) are used in connection with individual loans sold to or securitized by Fannie Mae. These Forms provide the terms of mortgage insurance coverage on individual loans. A list of Fannie Mae-approved Forms for each insurance provider is available on Fannie Mae’s website – see Approved Mortgage Insurance Forms.
Any mortgage loan sold to or securitized by Fannie Mae that requires primary mortgage insurance (or is delivered with primary mortgage insurance even though not required) and has a loan application date on or after October 1, 2014, must be insured under one of the Fannie Mae-approved Forms. If such loan is insured under any pre-existing forms or agreements between lenders and mortgage insurers, the loan is not eligible for sale to Fannie Mae, and is subject to repurchase if identiﬁed after acquisition by Fannie Mae.
Any mortgage loan sold to or securitized by Fannie Mae that requires primary mortgage insurance (or is delivered with primary mortgage insurance even though not required) and has a loan application date prior to October 1, 2014, may be insured under either
one of the Fannie Mae-approved Forms; or
any pre-existing forms and agreements between lenders and mortgage insurers, as long as the lender ﬁrst conﬁrms with the mortgage insurer that such forms and agreements were approved by Fannie Mae for use at the time of the loan application date.
LTV Ratio Determination in New York State
Under a New York statute, a mortgage insurer must issue mortgage insurance based on a determination of the “fair market value” of the property. The term “fair market value” is not deﬁned in the statute, but has been deﬁned by the New York insurance regulator as being the “appraised value.” Per the statute, for co-op properties, the issuance of mortgage insurance must be based on the “purchase price of the ownership interest and the proprietary lease.”
As a result, the determination of value for properties in New York is diﬀerent from Fannie Mae’s standard deﬁnition of value that is used to calculate the LTV ratio. The following table identiﬁes the value calculation that is to be used for mortgage loans secured by properties in New York for policies that are based on the LTV ratio.
Published February 5, 2025
815
LTV Ratio Calculation
LTV ratio based on the appraised value for non-
co-op properties
Published February 5, 2025
Policy
Lenders must base their determination of when
mortgage insurance is required solely on the
appraised value of the property. If the appraised value
of the property exceeds the sales price, this
determination may result in mortgage insurance not
being placed on a mortgage loan as would otherwise
be required using Fannie Mae’s standard deﬁnition.
If this calculation results in mortgage insurance not
being placed on the loan where mortgage insurance
would otherwise have been required using Fannie
Mae’s standard deﬁnition, the lender must deliver the
loan to Fannie Mae using the MI Absence Reason Type
of “No MI Based On Original LTV” (Sort ID 429).

Published February 5, 2025
Policy
For purchase transactions, lenders must base their
determination of when mortgage insurance is required
solely on the sales price for the co-op property. If the
sales price of the property is more than the appraised
value, this determination may result in mortgage
insurance not being placed on a mortgage loan as
would otherwise be required using Fannie Mae’s
standard deﬁnition.
Note: For purchase transactions when the co-op
property is subject to resale restrictions that
terminate automatically upon foreclosure and the
appraised value exceeds the sales price, lenders may
use the appraised value of the property without resale
restrictions, rather than the sales price when
determining when mortgage insurance is required. For
additional information on calculating LTV ratios on
loans with resale restrictions, see B5-5.2-02, Loans
with Resale Restrictions: Eligibility, Collateral and
Delivery Requirements and B5-5.3-03, Shared Equity
Transactions: Eligibility, Underwriting and Collateral
Requirements.
If this calculation results in mortgage insurance not
being placed on the loan where mortgage insurance
would otherwise have been required using Fannie
Mae’s standard deﬁnition, the lender must deliver the
loan to Fannie Mae using the MI Absence Reason Type
of “No MI Based On Original LTV” (Sort ID 429).
Lenders must base their determination of when
mortgage insurance is required for a reﬁnance
transaction for co-op share loans solely on the
appraised value.
817
LTV Ratio Calculation
Policy
Irrespective of the use of appraised value or sales
price for determining whether mortgage insurance is
required, this standard LTV ratio calculation must be
used to determine the level of mortgage insurance
coverage that is required on the mortgage loan. See
B1-1-01, Contents of the Application Package, and
B7-1-02, Mortgage Insurance Coverage Requirements,
for additional information.
The standard LTV ratio calculation must also be
LTV ratio based on the lower of the sales price
or appraised value (standard LTV ratio
calculation) for all property types
used
⚬ to determine whether the loan satisﬁes any of
Fannie Mae’s other eligibility criteria that are based on
the LTV ratio of the loan;
⚬ to determine any loan-level price adjustments
derived from Fannie Mae’s pricing matrix that includes
LTV ratios or CLTV ratios as a risk attribute in its
lookup table; and
⚬ when the loan is delivered to Fannie Mae (Sort ID
254). (The standard LTV ratio must be delivered even
if the appraised value or sales price is used to
determine that mortgage insurance coverage is not
required.)
Payment of Mortgage Insurance Premiums
Premium plans for mortgage insurance may be:
monthly plans – monthly premiums from accumulated escrow deposits (with no initial payment at closing),
annual plans – an initial payment at closing to cover the ﬁrst year's premium and annual renewal premiums thereafter paid from accumulated escrow deposits,
single-premium plans – lump-sum premium at closing to purchase life-of-the-mortgage coverage, or
split-premium plans – an initial payment at closing and an ongoing monthly premium from accumulated escrow deposits.
Mortgage Insurability
Each loan a lender delivers to Fannie Mae must be insurable. A mortgage is insurable if a mortgage insurer would not decline to insure it by reason of any fraud, misrepresentation, negligence, or dishonest, criminal, or
Published February 5, 2025
818
knowingly wrongful act in origination or servicing, and would not be entitled to deny a claim by reason of any of the foregoing.
Prohibition of Certain Mortgage Insurance Agreements
Fannie Mae prohibits lenders from entering into any agreement that modiﬁes the terms of an approved mortgage insurance master policy on loans delivered to or intended for delivery to Fannie Mae. Prohibited agreements include, but are not limited to, agreements that directly or indirectly:
modify master policy provisions for settling of claims,
limit the right of a mortgage insurer to conduct ﬁle reviews or investigate claims,
limit the right of a mortgage insurer to rescind coverage,
rescind or modify coverage, or
restrict notice to Fannie Mae of changes in coverage status.
Further, Fannie Mae prohibits loss sharing, indemniﬁcation, settlement, or similar agreements of any kind between lenders and mortgage insurance companies that aﬀect Fannie Mae's interest in its mortgage loans or modify the terms of an approved mortgage insurance master policy on loans delivered to or intended for delivery to Fannie Mae. Traditional captive reinsurance arrangements between a mortgage insurance company and a licensed insurer or reinsurer may be permissible so long as they do not:
aﬀect Fannie Mae's interest in its mortgage loans, or
modify the terms of an approved mortgage insurance master policy on loans delivered to or intended for delivery to Fannie Mae.

Mortgage Insurance Coverage Requirements
The table below provides the mortgage insurance coverage requirements for ﬁrst–lien mortgages. For certain transactions, Fannie Mae oﬀers two mortgage insurance coverage level options: standard coverage for the transaction type (noted with ^) and minimum coverage (noted with *) with corresponding LLPAs. Lenders who choose less than standard coverage (but no lower than minimum coverage) will be assessed an LLPA based on the LTV ratio and representative credit score for the mortgage loan. The minimum mortgage insurance LLPAs can be found in the Loan-Level Price Adjustment (LLPA) Matrix, and are in addition to any other LLPAs that may apply to the transaction.

B7-1-03, Lender-Purchased Mortgage Insurance (05/27/2010)
Introduction This topic contains information on lender-purchased mortgage insurance, including:
Overview Lender Requirements
Overview
Fannie Mae accepts lender-purchased mortgage insurance coverage for all loan types except adjustable-rate mortgages that can be converted to ﬁxed-rate mortgages.
Fannie Mae will consider accepting lender-purchased mortgage insurance for convertible adjustable-rate mortgages that are in MBS pools if the lender uses the “market rate” post-conversion disposition option and assumes all interest rate risk.
Lender Requirements
When providing lender-purchased mortgage insurance, the lender must:
make any and all disclosures to the borrower that are either required by law, including the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998, or are otherwise appropriate for lender-purchased mortgage insurance coverage;
pay for the mortgage insurance coverage as a corporate obligation with an initial premium and renewal premiums for each subsequent period of coverage, which may be a month or a year. Lump-sum premium plans that provide coverage for the life-of-the-mortgage loan also are acceptable;
increase the servicing compensation it would otherwise be required to retain for the mortgage loan (whether the mortgage loan is submitted as a whole loan or MBS pool delivery) by at least the amount of the mortgage insurance renewal premium. (This is not required for lump-sum premium plans that provide life-of-the-mortgage coverage.);
keep the mortgage insurance coverage in eﬀect until the mortgage is paid in full;
deliver the loan with SFC 019; and
when servicing is transferred, the lender must provide the new servicer with a list of all mortgage loans with this type of insurance that are included in the portfolio that is being transferred (identifying the applicable premium rates), explaining the premium payment obligations and procedures applicable to these mortgage loans, and transferring the accruals on deposit for the payment of future renewal premiums to the new servicer (or making an appropriate adjustment to the servicing transfer settlement).

B7-1-04, Financed Borrower-Purchased Mortgage Insurance
(12/15/2021)
Introduction This topic contains information on ﬁnanced borrower-purchased mortgage insurance, including:
Financed Mortgage Insurance Requirements Ineligible Transactions Delivery Requirements Prepaid Mortgage Insurance Transactions
Financed Mortgage Insurance Requirements
Financed mortgage insurance transactions are deﬁned by all of the following characteristics:
All or a portion of the borrower-purchased mortgage insurance premium (split and single-premium plans) is included in the loan amount.
The loan amount including the ﬁnanced mortgage insurance premium cannot exceed the applicable maximum Fannie Mae loan limit. See B2-1.5-01, Loan Limits.
The loan purpose is purchase, construction, or limited cash-out reﬁnance.
The loan is secured by a one-unit property that is the borrower’s principal residence or second home.
The mortgage insurance coverage amount can be standard coverage (which does not require an LLPA) or minimum coverage (with a corresponding LLPA).
The mortgage insurance coverage amount is determined based on the base (or net) LTV ratio – the LTV ratio calculated without the ﬁnanced premium.
The gross LTV ratio – the LTV ratio calculated with the ﬁnanced premium – is used to determine the maximum LTV ratio permitted for the transaction. The LTV ratio may never exceed the LTV ratio allowed per the Eligibility Matrix.
If the loan is subject to any LLPAs, the LLPAs are based on the gross LTV ratio, except for minimum mortgage insurance LLPAs, which are based on the base (or net) LTV ratio.
The lender must ensure that language related to any ﬁnanced mortgage insurance premium is included either directly in the applicable mortgage insurance master primary policy or in an endorsement to that policy, which language provides that the insurance beneﬁt paid pursuant to the “percentage option” in satisfaction of a claim be calculated as:
[the claim amount minus the unamortized portion of the ﬁnanced mortgage insurance premium] multiplied by the applicable coverage percentage, PLUS
the unamortized portion of the ﬁnanced mortgage insurance premium.
Certain delivery requirements for ﬁnanced mortgage insurance transactions must be met. See Delivery Requirements below.
Published February 5, 2025
823
Note: Fannie Mae provides two options for limited cash-out reﬁnance transactions that include mortgage insurance in the loan amount. A “ﬁnanced mortgage insurance transaction” requires the lender to identify the upfront ﬁnanced mortgage insurance amount separately and provide the required special feature code at delivery such that the base LTV can be determined. All of the above requirements must be met for the transaction to be deﬁned as a ﬁnanced mortgage insurance transaction. A “prepaid mortgage insurance transaction” permits the lender to include the amount of the upfront mortgage insurance premium and other allowable closing costs and prepaid items in the loan amount, and not separately identify the prepaid mortgage insurance at delivery. See Prepaid Mortgage Insurance Transactions below for additional information.
Ineligible Transactions
The following mortgage loans are not eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae if they include ﬁnanced borrower- purchased mortgage insurance:
mortgage loans secured by two- to-four-unit properties,
mortgage loans secured by investment properties, and
cash-out reﬁnance loans.
Note: Lender-paid mortgage insurance premiums cannot be ﬁnanced into the loan amount and are therefore not considered ﬁnanced mortgage insurance transactions.
Delivery Requirements
The following delivery requirements apply to ﬁnanced mortgage insurance transactions:
The Financed MI Amount and MI Financed Indicator must be delivered.
The delivery ﬁle must also contain the purchase price (for purchase transactions) and appraised value (for purchase and reﬁnance transactions) to allow for accurate calculation of the base LTV ratio.
The loan must be delivered with SFC 281.
All other mortgage insurance-related data elements must be provided (MI Company Name, Percent of MI Coverage, Certiﬁcate Number, and MI Source).
For additional information, see Uniform Loan Delivery Dataset (ULDD) on Fannie Mae's website.
Prepaid Mortgage Insurance Transactions
Fannie Mae’s reﬁnance guidelines permit borrowers to ﬁnance the payment of closing costs, prepaid items, and points in the loan amount. When the borrower includes any portion of the borrower-paid mortgage insurance premium or monthly escrows into the loan amount (with other closing costs or prepaid items), it is considered a “prepaid mortgage insurance transaction” and not a ﬁnanced mortgage insurance transaction. For a loan to be eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae with prepaid mortgage insurance, the loan must meet all the standard requirements of this Selling Guide, and the following requirements applicable to this type of loan:
Published February 5, 2025
824
The mortgage insurance coverage amount is determined based on the LTV ratio that is calculated after the inclusion of all the closing costs, prepaid items, and points. (The concept of “gross LTV ratio” and “base LTV ratio” are not applicable to prepaid mortgage insurance transactions because the ﬁnanced mortgage insurance amount is not identiﬁed at loan delivery.)
The loan is not to be delivered as a ﬁnanced mortgage insurance transaction – lenders should not deliver SFC 281 or the other ﬁnanced mortgage insurance data elements.
The Financed MI Premium Endorsement to the mortgage insurance policy should not be obtained.

Inability to Obtain Guaranty or Insurance Prior to Delivery
Evidence of the guaranty or insurance should be obtained before loan delivery, if possible. If this is not possible, the lender represents and warrants, by delivery of the loan, all of the following:
A complete and satisfactory mortgage guaranty or insurance application was submitted to the government agency within the required time frame, either based on an agency’s prior approval of the loan application and issuance of a commitment to insure or guarantee, or subject to an agency’s delegated or automatic loan approval processing, as applicable.
The mortgage insurance premiums, funding fee, or guarantee fees were paid to the government agency within the government agency’s required time frame.
The government agency has the legal authority to issue the guaranty or insurance and will have such authority for long enough to issue the guaranty or insurance within a time period that is consistent with its past practice.
After delivery of a mortgage loan, if a lender fails to obtain the guaranty or insurance in a timely manner, as determined by Fannie Mae, the lender must repurchase the mortgage and make Fannie Mae whole for any losses incurred by Fannie Mae. In addition, Fannie Mae may suspend or terminate the lender’s authority to deliver the following:
mortgages for which it has not already received the government mortgage guaranty or insurance,
any government mortgage or any particular category of government mortgage, or
any mortgage.
The lender must notify its Fannie Mae customer account team if the government agency declines to issue the mortgage guaranty or insurance for any reason for any loan delivered to Fannie Mae.
Fannie Mae may require the lender to provide periodic reports on the guaranty or insurance status for all government mortgages sold to Fannie Mae. Such reports must be provided within the requested time frame.
Lapse of Governmental Authority
Occasionally, a government agency’s guaranty or insurance authority may lapse. This occurrence is in contrast to ordinary circumstances in which there may be a delay in obtaining the government guaranty or insurance, but there is no reason to expect the government agency not to provide the guaranty or insurance within a time

period that is consistent with its past practice.
Mortgages that are not yet guaranteed or insured due to a lapse of governmental authority must be delivered with the government loan identiﬁer in accordance with Fannie Mae’s usual procedures. However, for credit enhancement purposes, Fannie Mae treats such mortgages as conventional mortgages, rather than as government mortgages.
Fannie Mae will accept delivery of such mortgages only if:
The government agency is continuing to accept applications and permit lenders to create direct endorsements or conditional commitments during the period of the lapse.
The delivery is for portfolio purchase rather than issuance of MBS.
The lender agrees to the repurchase requirements described below.
The lender must repurchase the mortgage and make Fannie Mae whole for any losses incurred by Fannie Mae in the following situations:
for whole loans in Fannie Mae's portfolio, if the mortgage becomes delinquent before the insurance or guaranty is issued;
the lender fails to notify Fannie Mae of its receipt of the guaranty or insurance within 60 days of when the government agency resumes issuance of the guaranty or insurance;
the lender delivers a mortgage that the government agency cannot insure or guarantee.
Special Feature Code for Lapse of Government Authority
When a lender delivers mortgages during a lapse in government authority, it must include the government loan identiﬁer in accordance with Fannie Mae’s usual procedures and report SFC 001 at delivery, to indicate the existence of the lender’s repurchase obligation in lieu of the government guaranty or insurance.
Upon receipt of the guaranty or insurance, the lender must contact its Fannie Mae customer account team to request removal of SFC 001. Once it is removed, Fannie Mae’s record will reﬂect that the mortgage is government guaranteed or insured.

duly authorized and licensed, as required, to issue title insurance in the state where the property is located; and
further evaluated in accordance with the lender’s procedures for title insurer approval, which may include factors such as

Note: Iowa Title Guaranty is an acceptable title guarantor for properties located in the state of Iowa.
Insurer Covered by Reinsurance
If the lender accepts an insurer based on the strength of a reinsurer, both the primary insurer and the reinsuring company must be licensed, as required, to issue title insurance within the state where the property is located and are in good standing with that state’s insurance regulator.
Both insurance carriers must execute an Assumption of Liability Endorsement (Form 858) or an equivalent endorsement that provides for 100% reinsurance of the primary insurer’s policy and a 90-day written notice of termination of the reinsurance agreement. The alternative endorsement must be attached to the title insurance policy for each individual mortgage.

Other Requirements
Terms of Coverage
The title insurance policy must ensure that the title is generally acceptable and that the mortgage constitutes a lien of the required priority on a fee simple or leasehold estate in the property.
The title policy also must list all other liens and state that they are subordinate to Fannie Mae’s mortgage lien.
Loan Origination Date
Title Policy Requirements
The title policy must be written on one of the following forms:
the 2021 American Land Title Association (ALTA) Loan Policy;
an ALTA short form if it provides coverage equivalent to the
2021 ALTA Loan Policy and does not materially impair protection
On or after January 1, 2024
to Fannie Mae;
in states in which standard ALTA forms of coverage are, by law
or regulation, not used, the state-promulgated standard or short
form which provides same coverage as the equivalent ALTA form,
provided that those forms do not materially impair protection to
Fannie Mae.
The title policy must be written on one of the following forms:
the 2006 American Land Title Association (ALTA) Loan Policy or
2021 ALTA Loan Policy;
an ALTA short form if it provides coverage equivalent to either
the 2006 ALTA Loan Policy or 2021 ALTA Loan Policy and does not

in states in which standard ALTA forms of coverage are, by law
or regulation, not used, the state-promulgated standard or short
form which provides same coverage as the equivalent ALTA form,
provided that those forms do not materially impair protection to
Fannie Mae.
Eﬀective Date of Coverage
The eﬀective date of the title insurance coverage written on forms that do not provide the gap coverage included in the 2006 and 2021 ALTA policies may be no earlier than the later of the date of the ﬁnal disbursement of loan proceeds or the date the mortgage was recorded.
Because the 2006 and 2021 ALTA forms provide protection for the time between loan closing and recordation of the mortgage, policies written on those forms may be eﬀective as of loan closing.
Published February 5, 2025
830
Amount of Coverage
The amount of title insurance coverage must at least equal the original principal amount of the loan.
Other Requirements
If a mortgage is registered with MERS and is originated naming MERS as original mortgagee of record, solely as nominee for the lender named in the security instrument and the note, and the lender's successors and assigns, then the "insured mortgage" covered by the title insurance policy must be identiﬁed in the title insurance policy as the security instrument given to MERS, solely as nominee for the lender and lender's successors and assigns. However, under no circumstances may MERS be named as the insured of a title policy.
The title insurance coverage must include an environmental protection lien endorsement (ALTA 8.1 Environmental Protection Lien Endorsement or equivalent state form that provides the required coverage).
References are to the ALTA form of endorsement, but state forms may be used as described in Terms of Coverage. As an alternative to endorsements, the requisite protections may be incorporated into the policy. For loans originated prior to January 1, 2008, endorsement forms that meet Fannie Mae’s requirements at the time of origination are acceptable.
Title policies may not include the creditors’ rights exclusion language that ALTA adopted in 1990.

(05/03/2023)
Introduction This topic provides speciﬁc requirements for title insurance coverage related to certain types of loan products or types of subject properties, including:
Condo and PUD Unit Mortgages Co-op Share Loans Mortgages Subject to Leasehold Estates
Published February 5, 2025
831
Other Mortgages
Condo and PUD Unit Mortgages
The title insurance policy for a condo or PUD unit mortgage must describe all components of the unit estate.
For condo units, an ALTA 4 or 4.1 endorsement or its equivalent is required. For PUD units, an ALTA 5 or 5.1 endorsement or its equivalent is required. These endorsements must be attached to each policy or incorporated in the text of the policy.
If the unit owners own the common areas of the project as tenants in common, the policy for each unit mortgage must reﬂect that ownership. If the homeowners' association owns the common elements, areas, or facilities of the project separately (or holds them in a leasehold estate), the title insurance on those areas must insure that ownership. This title policy must show that title to the common elements, areas, or facilities is free and clear of any objectionable liens and encumbrances, including any statutory or mechanic's liens for labor or materials related to improvements on the common areas that began before the title policy was issued.
The title policy must protect Fannie Mae by insuring the following:
that the mortgage is superior to any lien for unpaid common expense assessments. (In jurisdictions that give these assessments a limited priority over a ﬁrst mortgage, the policy must provide assurance that those assessments have been paid through the eﬀective date of the policy.)
against any impairment or loss of title of Fannie Mae's ﬁrst mortgage caused by any past, present, or future violations of any covenants, conditions, or restrictions of the master deed for the project. (It must speciﬁcally insure against any loss that results from a violation that existed as of the date of the policy.)
that the unit does not encroach on another unit or on any of the common elements, areas, or facilities. (The policy also must insure that there is no encroachment on the unit by another unit or by any of the common elements, areas, or facilities.)
that the loan is secured by a unit in a condo project that has been created in compliance with the applicable enabling statutes;
that real estate taxes are assessable and lienable only against the individual condo unit and its undivided interest in the common elements, rather than against the project as a whole; and
that the owner of a PUD unit is a member of the homeowners' association and that the membership is transferable if the unit is sold.
Co-op Share Loans
When co-op shares are recognized as real property, a title policy is required. Title evidence for a co-op share loan must ensure that:
the title is generally acceptable,
the borrower has good and marketable title to the shares, and
the co-op corporation has good and marketable title to the project.
Published February 5, 2025
832
When co-op shares are considered personal property and therefore cannot be insured under standard title policies, the title must be generally acceptable, the borrower must have title to the shares, and the co-op corporation must have good and marketable title to the project.
Mortgages Subject to Leasehold Estates
A mortgage that is subject to a leasehold estate must have an ALTA Endorsement 13.1.
For loans secured by properties held by a community land trust, see Title Insurance and Delivery Requirements in B5-5.3-03, Shared Equity Transactions: Eligibility, Underwriting and Collateral Requirements.
Other Mortgages
The table below provides the title insurance coverage requirements or endorsements for other types of loans.

For a HUD-guaranteed Section 184 mortgage, when title to

Mae requires a title insurance policy that satisﬁes its

general requirements.
For all other HUD-guaranteed Section 184 mortgages,
Fannie Mae relies on the title status report issued by the
Land Titles and Records Oﬃce of the Bureau of Indian
Aﬀairs.

Equity Loan Mortgage Endorsement (Form T-42.1). Refer to
B5-4.1-03, Texas Section 50(a)(6) Loan Underwriting,
Collateral, and Closing Considerations for more
information.
When closed as a single transaction for both the
construction loan and the permanent ﬁnancing, the policy
must be dated concurrently with the date of the mortgage
and must include (1) a "pending disbursements" clause
and (2) a ﬁnal endorsement to the title policy that extends
the eﬀective date of the coverage to the later of the ﬁnal
construction advance date or the endorsement date.
When closed as two separate transactions (one for the
construction phase and one for the permanent ﬁnancing),
the policy must satisfy Fannie Mae's standard title
insurance requirements for permanent mortgages.
If the notarized document is a security instrument or an
amendment to a security instrument, the remote
notarization must be disclosed to the title company
providing title insurance coverage and either:
an aﬃrmative endorsement to the title insurance policy
is obtained regarding Exclusion 3(b) in the standard ALTA
terms and conditions; or
the title insurer has not taken an exception for the
remote notarization in the title insurance policy and all
related communications with the title insurer are kept in
the loan ﬁle.

Title Exceptions Minor Impediments to Title for Conventional Loans Title Impediment – Loans Secured by Properties with Unexpired Redemption Periods
Title Exceptions
Fannie Mae will not purchase or securitize a loan secured by property that has an unacceptable title impediment, particularly unpaid real estate taxes and survey exceptions.
If surveys are not commonly required in particular jurisdictions, the lender must provide an ALTA 9 Endorsement. If it is not customary in a particular area to supply either the survey or an endorsement, the title policy must not have a survey exception.
Minor title impediments must not materially aﬀect the marketability of the property. The lender must indemnify Fannie Mae (as described in A2-1-03, Indemniﬁcation for Losses) for any Fannie Mae losses that can be directly attributed to the impediment(s).
Published February 5, 2025
835
Minor Impediments to Title for Conventional Loans
Title for a property that secures a conventional loan is acceptable even though it may be subject to the following conditions, which Fannie Mae considers minor impediments:
customary public utility subsurface easements that were in place and completely covered when the loan was originated, as long as they do not extend under any buildings or other improvements;
above-surface public utility easements that extend along one or more of the property lines for distribution purposes or along the rear property line for drainage purposes, as long as they do not extend more than 12 feet from the property lines and do not interfere with any of the buildings or improvements or with the use of the property itself;
mutual easement agreements that establish joint driveways or party walls constructed on the security property and on an adjoining property, as long as all future owners have unlimited and unrestricted use of them;
restrictive covenants and conditions, and cost, minimum dwelling size, or set back restrictions, as long as their violation will not result in a forfeiture or reversion of title or a lien of any kind for damages, or have an adverse eﬀect on the fair market value of the property;
encroachments of one foot or less on adjoining property by eaves or other overhanging projections or by driveways, as long as there is at least a ten-foot clearance between the buildings on the security property and the property line aﬀected by the encroachment;
encroachments on adjoining properties, as long as those encroachments consist only of hedges or removable fences;
outstanding oil, water, or mineral rights that are customarily waived by other lenders, as long as they do not materially alter the contour of the property or impair its value or usefulness for its intended purposes;
variations between the appraisal report and the records of possession regarding the length of the property lines, as long as the variations do not interfere with the current use of the improvements and are within an acceptable range. (For front property lines, a 2% variation is acceptable; for all other property lines, 5% is acceptable.);
rights of lawful parties in possession, as long as such rights do not include the right of ﬁrst refusal to purchase the property. (No rights of parties in possession, including the term of a tenant’s lease, may have a duration of more than two years.);
minor discrepancies in the description of the area, as long as the lender provides a survey and aﬃrmative title insurance against all loss or damage resulting from the discrepancies;
exceptions to Indian claims, as long as the lender is insured against all loss and damage from such claims.
Title Impediment – Loans Secured by Properties with Unexpired Redemption Periods
Certain state laws provide a “redemption period” after a foreclosure or tax sale has occurred, during which time the property may be reclaimed by the prior mortgagor or other party upon payment of all amounts owed. The length of the redemption period varies by state and does not expire automatically upon sale of the property to a
Published February 5, 2025

new owner. Although an unexpired redemption period will generally be deemed to be an unacceptable title impediment, Fannie Mae will consider it to be acceptable provided the following requirements are met:
✓
Requirements for Loans Subject to Unexpired Redemption Periods
The property must be located in a state where it is common and customary to sell single-
family residential property during the redemption period.
Note: Loans representing the purchase of Fannie Mae-owned properties which have been
sold during the redemption period may be subject to separate negotiations.
The mortgagee policy of title insurance must take speciﬁc exception to the unexpired right
of redemption but also aﬃrmatively insure the mortgagee against all loss arising out of the
exercise of any outstanding right of redemption, without qualiﬁcation.
If any party exercises a right to redeem the mortgaged property, the loan must be paid oﬀ
directly out of the redemption proceeds with no requirement for any further action or claim
for repayment.
The lender must indemnify Fannie Mae (as described in A2-1-03, Indemniﬁcation for Losses)
for any losses incurred by Fannie Mae that can be directly attributed to the exercise by any
party of a right to redeem the mortgaged property, including without limitation, a loss
related to borrower default due to a dispute with the redeeming party over the terms of the
redemption.
Note: Fannie Mae strongly encourages lenders to provide written disclosure to borrowers of properties that are subject to unexpired redemption periods if not otherwise required by law (or disclosed by the title company).

Overview Property Insurer Rating Requirements Exceptions to Insurer Rating Requirements Other Exceptions to Property Insurance Requirements
Overview
The borrower has the right to select the insurer of their choice to provide property insurance for the subject property, provided that the insurance meets Fannie Mae's requirements. The lender or servicer must ensure that the insurer, policy, and coverage meet Fannie Mae's requirements. In some cases, Fannie Mae may require additional coverage that diﬀers from these requirements.
Note: References to "lender or servicer" include the lender or seller at origination and the servicer for the duration of loan servicing.
Property Insurer Rating Requirements
The property insurance policy for the property securing any ﬁrst mortgage, including master policies for project developments, must be written by an insurer that meets one of the rating requirements in the following table.
Rating Agency
Rating Category
AM Best Company
“B” or better Financial Strength Rating
Demotech, Inc.
“A” or better Insurance Financial Stability Rating
Kroll Bond Rating Agency
“BBB” or better Insurance Financial Strength Rating
(IFSR)
S&P Global
“BBB” or better Insurer Financial Strength Rating
Note: An insurer is only required to meet the rating category requirement for one of the rating agencies, even if they are rated by multiple rating agencies.
Exceptions to Insurer Rating Requirements
The following are exceptions to Fannie Mae’s insurer rating requirements:
Second Mortgages — The property insurance policy for a property that secures a second mortgage does not have to be written by an insurer that meets Fannie Mae’s rating requirements, unless Fannie Mae also has an interest in the ﬁrst mortgage.
Published February 5, 2025
841
Mortgage Impairment (or Mortgagee Interest) Insurance — If the lender or servicer, as applicable, is covered by a mortgage impairment (or mortgagee interest) insurance policy, and the issuer meets either the AM Best Financial Strength Rating or S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating, as listed in Property Insurer Rating Requirements, Fannie Mae does not require conﬁrmation that the borrower’s property insurance coverage is with an insurer that meets Fannie Mae’s rating requirements. However, in such instances, the lender should advise the borrower of Fannie Mae’s requirements when it originates the loan.
Reinsurance Arrangements — Policies written by an insurer that do not meet Fannie Mae’s rating requirements are acceptable provided all conditions outlined in the following table are met.
✓
Conditions for Acceptable Reinsurance Arrangements
The insurer is covered by reinsurance with a company that meets the AM Best Financial Strength
Ratings or S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating, as listed in Property Insurer Rating
Requirements.
The primary insurer and the reinsuring company are authorized (or licensed, if required) to
transact business within the state where the property is located.
The reinsurance agreement has a “cut-through” endorsement that provides for the reinsurer to
become immediately liable for 100% of any loss payable by the primary insurer in the event the
primary insurer becomes insolvent.
Both the primary insurer and the reinsuring company execute an Assumption of Liability
Endorsement (Form 858), or any equivalent endorsement that provides for 100% reinsurance of
the primary insurer’s policy and a 90-day written notice to Fannie Mae of the termination of the
reinsurance arrangement.
Note: Form 858 (or the equivalent endorsement) must be attached to each insurance policy
covered by the reinsurance agreement, unless the lender or servicer, as applicable, is covered
by a mortgage impairment (or mortgagee interest) insurance policy.
The reinsurance agreement does not allow contributions or assessments to be made against
Fannie Mae or to become a lien on the property that is superior to Fannie Mae’s lien.
The insurance written under the policy cannot exceed any dollar limitation amount speciﬁed in
the reinsurance endorsement.
Other Exceptions to Property Insurance Requirements
Fannie Mae also accepts the following types of property insurance policies if they are the only coverage that can be obtained at the time of the loan closing or policy renewal:

Introduction This topic contains information on property insurance requirements for one- to four-unit properties, including:
Coverage Requirements Determining the Required Coverage Amount Deductible Requirements
Coverage Requirements
Property insurance policies for one- to four-unit properties securing loans purchased by Fannie Mae should be written on a "Special" coverage form or equivalent. At a minimum, the coverage must include the perils listed in the following table.
✓
Required Perils
Fire or lightning
Explosion
Published February 5, 2025
843
✓
Required Perils
Windstorm (including named storms designated by the U.S. National Weather Service or the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration by a name or number)
Hail
Smoke
Aircraft
Vehicles
Riot or civil commotion
If a property insurance policy excludes or limits coverage of any of the required perils, the borrower must obtain an acceptable stand-alone policy that provides adequate coverage for the limited or excluded peril (see B7-3-05, Additional Insurance Requirements, for additional information).
The property insurance policy must provide for claims to be settled on a replacement cost basis. Property insurance policies that provide for claims to be settled on an actual cash value basis are not acceptable. Policies that limit, depreciate, reduce or otherwise settle losses at anything other than a replacement cost basis are also not acceptable.
Additional requirements apply to properties with solar panels that are leased from or owned by a third party under a power purchase agreement or other similar arrangement. See B2-3-04, Special Property Eligibility Considerations, for additional requirements.
See B7-3-08, Mortgagee Clause, Named Insured, and Notice of Cancellation Requirements for additional requirements applicable to a one- to four-unit property.
Determining the Required Coverage Amount
The lender or servicer must verify that the property insurance coverage amount for a ﬁrst mortgage secured by a one- to four-unit property is at least equal to the lesser of:
100% of the replacement cost value of the improvements as of the current property insurance policy eﬀective date, or the unpaid principal balance of the loan, provided it equals no less than 80% of the replacement cost value of the improvements as of the current property insurance policy eﬀective date.
The source that the lender or servicer uses to verify the coverage amount may be the property insurer, an independent insurance risk specialist, or other professional with appropriate resources to make such a determination. This may include, but is not limited to, a statement from the insurer or other applicable

Compare the replacement cost value of the improvements to the unpaid principal balance (UPB)
of the loan.
1A
If the replacement cost value of the improvements is less than the UPB, the replacement cost
value is the amount of coverage required.
1B
If the UPB of the loan is less than the replacement cost value of the improvements, go to Step 2.
2
Calculate 80% of the replacement cost value of the improvements.
2A
If the result of this calculation is equal to or less than the UPB of the loan, the UPB is the amount
of coverage required.
2B
If the result of this calculation is greater than the UPB of the loan, this calculated ﬁgure is the
amount of coverage required.
Note: When calculating the required amount of property insurance coverage, the loan amount must be used at origination and the UPB must be used during servicing of the loan.

Overview
This topic covers requirements for master property insurance policies covering the common elements and residential structures of project developments.
The requirements applicable to condo projects in this topic also apply to two- to four-unit condos and detached condos, unless stated otherwise.
For the purposes of this topic and B7-3-04, Individual Property Insurance Requirements for a Unit in a Project Development, the following deﬁnitions apply:
Common elements refers to insurable, non-residential elements of a project development. Examples include, but are not limited to, clubhouses, parking areas or structures, and recreational facilities. Residential structures refers to the insurable elements of a building that contains one or more residences.
Determining if a Master Property Insurance Policy is Required
The requirements for individual property insurance policies will vary based on the homeowners' association (HOA) or co-op corporation's legal documents and the master property insurance policy. The following table provides the requirements based on the project type.
Published February 5, 2025
847
Project Type
Requirement
Individual property insurance policies as described in B7-3-02, Property Insurance Requirements
for One-to Four-Unit Properties are required for each property securing a loan that Fannie Mae
purchases in a PUD project unless the project's legal documents provide for a master property
insurance policy that covers both the common elements and residential structures. In that case,
Fannie Mae will accept the master property insurance policy in satisfaction of its insurance
requirements for the subject property. The borrower may still have to maintain an individual unit
PUD
owner policy as described in Coverage Requirements in this topic.
When units located within a PUD are covered by a master property insurance policy maintained by
the HOA, the lender or servicer must verify that the insurance provides coverage for both the
common elements and residential structures.
When units located within a PUD are covered by individual property insurance policies maintained
by their respective owner(s), the lender or servicer is not required to verify master property
insurance coverage on PUD common elements.
Master property insurance policies are required for the common elements and residential structures
for each loan that Fannie Mae purchases in a condo project unless the condo project's legal
documents require individual property insurance policies for each unit. In that case, the individual
property insurance policy must meet the requirements in B7-3-02, Property Insurance
Condo
Requirements for One-to Four-Unit Properties.
When a master property insurance policy is required, the lender or servicer must verify that the
master property insurance provides coverage for both the common elements and residential
structures. The borrower may still have to maintain an individual unit owner policy as described in
Coverage Requirements in this topic.
Master property insurance policies are required for the common elements and residential structures
for each loan that Fannie Mae purchases in a co-op project unless the co-op project's legal
documents require individual property insurance policies for each unit. In that case, the individual
property insurance policy must meet the requirements in B7-3-02, Property Insurance
Co-op
Requirements for One-to Four-Unit Properties.
When a master property insurance policy is required, the lender or servicer must verify that the
master property insurance provides coverage for both the common elements and residential
structures. The borrower may still have to maintain an individual unit owner policy as described in
Coverage Requirements in this topic.
To the extent the master property insurance policy does not cover the interior of the unit or improvements to the unit, the borrower must maintain an individual unit owner property insurance policy (see B7-3-04, Individual Property Insurance Requirements for a Unit in a Project Development for additional requirements).
Coverage Requirements
Published February 5, 2025
848
When required, a master property insurance policy must be maintained with premiums paid as a common expense by the HOA or co-op corporation, as applicable. The policy must cover all insurable property elements. Common personal property and supplies should be covered, if applicable.
The master property insurance policy must provide for claims to be settled on a replacement cost basis. Property insurance policies that provide for claims to be settled on an actual cash value basis are not acceptable. Policies that limit, depreciate, reduce or otherwise settle losses at anything other than a replacement cost basis are also not acceptable.
Master property insurance coverage policies covering project developments should be written on a "Special" coverage form or equivalent. At a minimum, the coverage must include the perils covered by a commercial "Broad" coverage form, as listed in the following table.
✓
Required Perils
Fire
Lightning
Explosion
Windstorm (including named storms designated by the U.S. National Weather Service or the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration by a name or number)

Required Perils
Falling objects
Weight of snow, ice or sleet
Water damage
If a master property insurance policy excludes or limits coverage of any of the required perils, the HOA or co-op corporation must obtain an acceptable stand-alone property insurance policy which provides adequate coverage for the limited or excluded peril (see B7-3-05, Additional Insurance Requirements for additional information).
See Named Insured for Property and Flood Insurance in B7-3-08, Mortgagee Clause, Named Insured, and Notice of Cancellation Requirements for the named insured requirements.
Determining the Required Coverage Amount
The lender or servicer must verify that the property insurance coverage amount is at least equal to 100% of the replacement cost value of the project improvements, including common elements and residential structures, as of the current property insurance policy eﬀective date.
The source that the lender or servicer uses to verify the coverage amount may be the property insurer, an independent insurance risk specialist, or other professional with appropriate resources to make such a determination. This may include, but is not limited to, a statement from the insurer or other applicable professional, a replacement cost estimator, or an insurance risk appraisal.
Deductible Requirements

amount.
Fannie Mae will allow a per unit master property insurance policy deductible when the
sum of the applicable per unit deductibles is greater than 5% of the coverage amount
and all of the following requirements are met.
1. The master property insurance policy has a per unit deductible for named perils

speciﬁc to a geographic area where such coverage is common and customary; and
2. The borrower's individual property insurance policy includes

b. coverage for master property insurance policy deductible assessments levied
on the unit owner by the HOA or co-op corporation for the applicable peril(s); and
c. loss assessment coverage in an amount suﬃcient to cover assessments in
excess of 5% of the master property insurance policy coverage amount, divided
by the number of units.
Note: A deductible buy-back insurance policy purchased by the HOA or co-op corporation may be used to meet Fannie Mae's master property insurance policy deductible requirements, provided the policy meets all other property insurance requirements in Chapter B7-3, Property and Flood Insurance, including insurer rating requirements.
Special Coverage Requirements for Project Developments
The following special coverage requirements apply to condo, co-op, and PUD master property insurance policies:
Inﬂation Guard Coverage - The coverage is not required if it is not obtainable in the insurance market available to the association; Building Ordinance or Law Coverage - The coverage must include:
Coverage A: loss to the undamaged portion of a building, Coverage B: demolition costs, and Coverage C: increased costs of construction.
Building Ordinance or Law Coverage may be included in the property coverage form or obtained as an endorsement to the property insurance policy. The coverage is not required if it is not obtainable in the insurance market available to the association; and
Boiler and Machinery/Equipment Breakdown Coverage - This coverage is required if the project development has central heating or cooling. The coverage amount must equal the lesser of $2 million or
Published February 5, 2025
851
the replacement cost value of the building(s) housing the boiler or machinery. This coverage may be included in the property coverage form, obtained as an endorsement to the master property insurance policy, or the HOA or co-op corporation may purchase a stand-alone boiler and machinery policy.
Note: Boiler and Machinery/Equipment Breakdown Coverage may also be referred to as Steam Boiler Coverage or Mechanical Breakdown Coverage.
Special Coverage Requirements for Condo Projects
Master property insurance policies for condo projects must be endorsed with a Condominium Association Coverage Form or its equivalent. The endorsement must include the following provisions or comparable language:
Recognition of an Insurance Trustee: If you name an insurance trustee, we will adjust losses with you, but we will pay the insurance trustee. If we pay the trustee, the payments will satisfy your claims against us. Waiver of Rights of Recovery: We waive our rights to recover payment from any unit-owner of the condominium that is shown in the declarations. Unit-owner's Insurance: A unit-owner may have other insurance covering the same property as this insurance. This insurance is intended to be primary, and not to contribute with such other insurance.
Builder/Developer Property Insurance Policies
When a project is under development, it may be covered by the builder/developer's property insurance policy if the policy provides equivalent coverage to the requirements for project developments in this topic. When property coverage ceases per the terms of the builder/developer's policy, the HOA or co-op corporation must obtain a master property insurance policy in accordance with Fannie Mae's requirements.
Separate projects under development by the same developer will be considered aﬃliated during the period when control of the project has not yet transferred from the builder/developer to the individual owners or related HOA or co-op corporation. The aﬃliated status of the subject project ends when the property coverage ceases per the terms of the builder/developer's policy.
Policies Covering Multiple Projects
Except as described below, unaﬃliated projects may not share a master property insurance policy. Each project must maintain its own policy that meets Fannie Mae requirements, as detailed throughout this topic.
If a property insurance policy that covers multiple unaﬃliated projects provides a dedicated coverage amount for each individual covered project, the policy structure may provide equivalent coverage to Fannie Mae's coverage amount requirements. The coverage amount dedicated to the subject project must be suﬃcient to cover the full replacement cost value of the project improvements including the common elements and residential structures.
The lender or servicer must review the insurance policy and any other associated documents needed to adequately evaluate the insurance coverage. The HOA or co-op corporation must be protected in the same manner as if it maintained a master property insurance policy. The coverage of each insured project cannot be aﬀected by any actions or omissions of unaﬃliated projects covered by the same policy. Additionally, all other
Published February 5, 2025
852
master property insurance requirements for project developments must be met.
The lender or servicer must document how they determined the applicable policy provides acceptable coverage as detailed above. A copy of the policy, along with the lender's or servicer's documentation must be maintained in the loan ﬁle.

Determining the Required Coverage Amount
To the extent the master property insurance policy does not cover the interior or improvements of a unit in a project development, the borrower must maintain an individual property insurance policy.
The lender or servicer must verify the coverage amount is suﬃcient to restore the unit to its condition prior to a loss event.
Coverage suﬃciency should be based on the best information known or available to the lender or servicer, which may include information obtained from the borrower, in collaboration with the insurer, the HOA or co-op corporation legal documents, or other professional with appropriate resources to make such a determination.
Fannie Mae recommends that lenders and servicers encourage borrowers to closely collaborate with an insurance professional to determine their individual insurance needs.

B7-3-05, Additional Insurance Requirements (12/14/2022)
Introduction This topic contains information on additional insurance requirements, including:
Additional Property Insurance Coverage Insurance Requirements for Renovation and Energy-Related Improvement Loans Optional Credit Life or Mortgage Loan Insurance
Additional Property Insurance Coverage
If a lender or servicer becomes aware of a subject property's exposure to perils that are not covered as required in Coverage Requirements in B7-3-02, Property Insurance Requirements for One-to Four-Unit Properties, or Coverage Requirements in B7-3-03, Master Property Insurance Requirements for Project Developments, such as toxic waste; it should contact Fannie Mae to determine whether additional coverage is necessary. Servicers should contact their Fannie Mae Servicing Representative (see Servicing Guide, F-4-02, List of Contacts) and lenders should contact their Fannie Mae Account Team (see E-1-02, List of Contacts).
Insurance Requirements for Renovation and Energy-Related Improvement Loans
When the loan provides funds to cover the costs of repairs, remodeling, renovations, or energy-related improvements, there must not be any coverage exclusions or limitations related to the renovation work during the time that work is being performed on the property.
Once repairs, renovation, or construction is complete, the lender or servicer must review the property insurance policy (and ﬂood insurance policy when required) to ensure the appropriate coverage is in place based on the completed replacement cost value of the subject property.
Optional Credit Life or Mortgage Loan Insurance
Fannie Mae allows insurance policies that include optional coverage such as those outlined below. However, Fannie Mae does not pay costs arising from disputes with insurers in settling claims that relate only to this optional coverage.
Acceptable Types of Optional Credit Life or Mortgage Loan Insurance
Permissible coverage includes:
single-premium credit insurance policies and debt cancellation agreements that are free in all respects to the borrower, single-premium mortgage insurance policies with a credit insurance feature where such credit insurance feature is free in all respects to the borrower, and credit insurance policies that require borrowers to pay a separately identiﬁed premium on a monthly or
Published February 5, 2025
855
annual basis or debt cancellation agreements that require borrowers to pay a separately identiﬁed fee on a monthly basis.
These credit insurance policies or debt cancellation agreements must be disclosed to the borrower in clear and simple terms in advance of purchase of the applicable policy or agreement.
Notwithstanding the lender's or servicer's compliance with the above requirements, Fannie Mae purchases loans with debt cancellation agreements only with Fannie Mae's express written approval of the overall debt cancellation feature. This includes the debt cancellation agreement, and execution by the lender or servicer and Fannie Mae of a separately negotiated agreement.
The lender or servicer may act as a broker or agent in the sale of this type of credit insurance to the borrower.
The lender or servicer must reimburse Fannie Mae for attorney's fees or any costs that it incurs if Fannie Mae brings an action on a defaulted loan and the borrower defends against Fannie Mae's foreclosure or acts to enjoin Fannie Mae from liquidating the loan and one of the defenses or actions for injunction is based on:
an obligation of the lender or servicer (including as the broker or agent that obtained the credit insurance for the borrower and/or as a party that has agreed to collect premiums and remit them to the credit insurer on the borrower's behalf), an obligation of the credit insurer, or the obligation of the mortgage insurer to maintain credit insurance and apply beneﬁts thereof to the borrower's loan.
Unacceptable Types of Optional Credit Life or Mortgage Loan Insurance
Although certain property insurance policies that include optional coverage are allowed, Fannie Mae does not purchase loans in the following situations:
The premium/fee for single-premium credit life insurance policies or debt cancellation agreements is paid directly by the borrower or paid indirectly by ﬁnancing the premium/fee into the loan amount. The premium/fee for single-premium mortgage insurance policies with a credit insurance feature is paid directly by the borrower or paid indirectly by rolling the credit insurance single premium into the cost of the mortgage insurance (whether or not it is identiﬁed as including a credit insurance premium).

Determining if a Property Requires Flood Insurance Determining if Flood Insurance is Required on Speciﬁc Structures Community Eligibility Acceptable Flood Insurance Policies Requirements for One- to Four-Unit Properties Requirements for Project Developments Deductible Requirements Delivery Requirements Requirements During a National Flood Insurance Program Lapse
Determining if a Property Requires Flood Insurance
The lender and servicer must ensure that the subject property is adequately protected by ﬂood insurance when required. Flood insurance coverage is required when a loan is secured by a property located in
a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), or
a Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS) or Otherwise Protected Area (OPA).
The lender and servicer must determine whether the property is located in an SFHA, a CBRS, or an OPA by using the FEMA Standard Flood Hazard Determination form. All ﬂood zones beginning with the letter "A" or "V" are considered SFHAs.
Note: If the subject property is located within a CBRS or an OPA, ﬂood insurance is required regardless of whether the property is located in an SFHA.
Flood insurance is not required on a principal or residential detached structure securing the loan if the lender or servicer obtains a letter from FEMA stating that its maps have been amended and the structure is no longer in an SFHA.
Determining if Flood Insurance is Required on Speciﬁc Structures
The following table describes how to evaluate a property to determine if ﬂood insurance is required. For these requirements, the "principal structure" is the primary residential structure on the subject property.

loan is located within the SFHA
Community Eligibility
If the lender or servicer determines that a principal or residential detached structure is located in an SFHA, but the community does not participate in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the loan is not eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae.
If the property is in a non-participating community and a CBRS or an OPA, it is only eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae if it is not located in an SFHA.
Loans secured by properties in the Emergency Program of the NFIP are eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae with coverage equivalent to the NFIP maximum that is available.
Acceptable Flood Insurance Policies
The ﬂood insurance policy must be one of the following:
a standard policy issued under the NFIP; or a policy issued by a private insurer, provided
the terms and amount of coverage are at least equal to that provided under an NFIP policy based on a review of the full policy issued by a private insurer, and
Published February 5, 2025
858
the insurer meets Fannie Mae's rating requirements as speciﬁed in Property Insurer Rating Requirements in B7-3-01, General Property Insurance Requirements for All Property Types.
A Policy Declaration page is acceptable evidence of ﬂood insurance.
Requirements for One- to Four-Unit Properties
The minimum amount of ﬂood insurance required for ﬁrst mortgages must be equal to the lesser of
100% of the replacement cost value of the improvements, the maximum coverage amount available from NFIP, or the unpaid principal balance (UPB) of the loan (or loan amount at the time of origination).
See Insurance Requirements for Renovation and Energy Improvement Loans in B7-3-05, Additional Insurance Requirements for additional information.
See Mortgagee Clause for Property and Flood Insurance and Named Insured for Property and Flood Insurance in B7-3-08, Mortgagee Clause, Named Insured, and Notice of Cancellation Requirements for mortgagee clause and named insured requirements.
Requirements for Project Developments
When a loan is secured by a unit in an attached condo or co-op project and ﬂood insurance is required as described in Determining if a Property Requires Flood Insurance, the lender and servicer must verify that the HOA or co-op corporation maintains a master ﬂood insurance policy with premiums paid as a common expense, unless otherwise indicated in the table below.
The following table provides additional requirements based on the project type.
Published February 5, 2025
859

Condo
Published February 5, 2025
Coverage Requirements
The lender and servicer must verify that the HOA maintains a Residential
Condominium Building Associated Policy (RCBAP) or equivalent private ﬂood
insurance coverage for a condo building consisting of attached units located
within an SFHA. The only building that must be veriﬁed is the subject unit's
building. Fannie Mae does not require evidence of a master ﬂood insurance
policy, provided the unit owner maintains an individual ﬂood dwelling policy that
meets the coverage requirements of this Guide for the following loans or project
types:
high LTV reﬁnance loans,
units in a two- to four-unit project, and
detached condo properties.
The master ﬂood insurance policy maintained by the HOA must cover the subject
unit's
entire building; and
all of the common elements and property, including machinery and equipment
that are part of the building.
The coverage amount for the building must be at least equal to the lesser of
80% of the replacement cost value(1), or
the maximum coverage amount available from NFIP per unit(2).
(1)If the master ﬂood insurance policy meets the minimum coverage requirement
of 80% of the replacement cost value, but the per unit coverage amount does
not meet the requirement for loans secured by one- to four-unit properties, as
described in Requirements for One- to Four-Unit Properties, the unit owner must
maintain a supplemental policy for the diﬀerence.
(2)If the commercial space of an attached condo is over 25%, coverage provided
by the General Property Form (or equivalent coverage) is insuﬃcient. A private
ﬂood insurance policy, or a private ﬂood insurance policy in conjunction with a
General Property Form policy (or equivalent coverage) must be maintained by
the HOA to equate to coverage requirements for projects eligible for an RCBAP.
The contents coverage must equal the lesser of
100% of the replacement cost value of all contents owned in common by the
association members, or
the maximum coverage amount available from NFIP.

The master ﬂood insurance policy maintained by the co-op corporation must
cover the subject unit's
Co-op
entire building, and
all of the common elements and property, including machinery and equipment
that are part of the building.
The coverage amount for the building must be at least equal to the lesser of
100% of the replacement cost value, or
the maximum coverage available from NFIP.
The lender and servicer must verify that each attached or detached individual
PUD unit maintains a Dwelling Form policy or equivalent private ﬂood insurance

For the duration of such a lapse, a lender may sell a loan to Fannie Mae where ﬂood insurance is otherwise required without an active ﬂood insurance policy provided the requirements below are met.
During the lapse, lenders must have a process in place to identify properties securing loans sold to us without proper evidence of active ﬂood insurance on the conditions that the borrower must provide acceptable evidence of:
a completed application for NFIP ﬂood insurance and proof of the premium payment or the ﬁnal settlement statement reﬂecting payment of the initial premium, or the assignment of an existing NFIP ﬂood insurance policy from the property seller to the purchaser.

When delivering loans aﬀected by a lapse of the NFIP, lenders must follow the Delivery Requirements described above and provide all applicable loan delivery data elements as if a required ﬂood insurance policy was in place.
The lender and servicer remain obligated for all selling representations and warranties and servicing obligations concerning the existence of a standard policy issued under the NFIP or an equivalent private ﬂood insurance policy.
Note: Fannie Mae accepts ﬂood insurance policies from private insurers as listed in Acceptable Flood Insurance Policies, but such private ﬂood insurance policy coverage is not a required alternative in the event of a lapse of NFIP coverage.

Introduction This topic contains information on evidence of property insurance, including:
Overview Certiﬁcates of Property Insurance Master Property Insurance Policies for Project Developments Electronic Data Files
Overview
The following requirements apply when documenting and retaining evidence of property insurance policies:
The lender or servicer must verify the existence of a valid insurance policy that meets Fannie Mae's requirements. Information related to the policy should be passed on to the servicer, when applicable. The lender or servicer must retain acceptable evidence of insurance for each required policy, which includes suﬃcient information about the insurance policy, the subject property, and the borrower to ensure compliance with Fannie Mae's requirements for a ﬁrst mortgage, unless the lender or servicer is covered by a mortgage impairment or mortgagee interest insurance policy or uses other evidence of insurance that Fannie Mae considers acceptable. The servicer of a second mortgage must retain a copy of the insurance policy, any endorsements to it, and evidence of premium payments. The servicer must verify at least annually that any property insurance policy for a one- to four-unit property or a unit in a project development meets Fannie Mae's requirements.
Note: If a lender is unable to determine whether the applicable insurance policy meets Fannie Mae's requirements, the associated loan is not eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae.
Certiﬁcates of Property Insurance
A lender or servicer may accept a certiﬁcate of property insurance in lieu of a complete property insurance policy if the certiﬁcate includes all of the information needed for the lender or servicer to determine whether the insurance meets Fannie Mae's requirements. The certiﬁcate of property insurance must be signed by the insurer.
Master Property Insurance Policies for Project Developments
When required, the lender or servicer must obtain a copy of the current master property insurance policy or a certiﬁcate of property insurance showing that the subject unit is covered under the master property insurance policy. See Servicing Guide, B-2-03, Master Property Insurance Requirements for Project Developments, for additional servicer responsibilities related to evidence of master property insurance policies for project developments.

Electronic Data Files
Electronic data ﬁles are acceptable in lieu of hard copy insurance policies if all the requirements in the following table are met.
✓
Requirements for Electronic Data Files for Insurance Policies
The data ﬁle must include suﬃcient information about the insurance policy, the subject property,
and the borrower to ensure that the servicer is able to comply with Fannie Mae's requirements
for maintaining and monitoring property insurance, such as
reviewing the insurance policy terms, amount of coverage, and deductibles;
conﬁrming that the premiums have been paid; and
processing loss drafts.
The lender's or servicer's errors and omissions insurance policy must acknowledge electronic
data transfers and fully protect the lender or servicer and Fannie Mae against losses incurred as
the result of erroneous data ﬁles or transfers.
The insurer must provide the lender or servicer with written assurance that the data ﬁle is
equivalent to a printed policy, typically through a detailed agreement between the two parties.
The lender or servicer must have appropriate procedures in place to mitigate risks associated
with not possessing an original hardcopy policy, which may include obtaining certiﬁcations from
the insurer as to the accuracy of certain information that the servicer is required to verify.
The lender or servicer must provide legible hard copies of the complete insurance policies and
proof of premium payments if Fannie Mae requests them.

Cancellation Requirements (12/14/2022)
Introduction This topic contains information on the mortgagee clause, named insured, and notice of cancellation requirements.
Mortgagee Clause for Property and Flood Insurance Named Insured for Property and Flood Insurance Notice of Cancellation for Property Insurance
Mortgagee Clause for Property and Flood Insurance
The following requirements apply to individual property and ﬂood insurance policies maintained by the borrower and do not apply to master property and ﬂood insurance policies for project developments.
Fannie Mae must not be named in the mortgagee clause unless the coverage or its interest would be impaired by Fannie Mae not being named. If Fannie Mae is named, the clause must read: "Fannie Mae, in care of (insert servicer's name and address here)." This ensures that all matters related to the applicable insurance policy are referred directly to the servicer and not to Fannie Mae.
When Fannie Mae is not named in the mortgagee clause, the lender's name, followed by the phrase "its successors and/or assigns," and mailing address must be shown as the mortgagee. If the lender is not the servicer, the servicer's name, followed by "its successors and/or assigns," and mailing address must be speciﬁed. In all cases, the insurer must be instructed to send all correspondence, policies, and bills to the servicer (or to both the ﬁrst and second mortgage servicers).
If the mortgage is registered with MERS and is originated naming MERS as the original mortgagee of record, MERS must not be named as mortgagee or loss payee on any property insurance policy. The mortgagee clause must name the servicer (unless Fannie Mae must be named because the coverage or its interest would be impaired as mentioned above).
The following table provides additional requirements for mortgagee clauses.

Developments (12/14/2022)
Introduction This topic contains information on general liability insurance requirements, including:
Determining if General Liability Insurance is Required Coverage Requirements Determining the Required Coverage Amount Named Insured
Determining if General Liability Insurance is Required
General liability insurance is required for all condo and co-op projects, with the following exceptions:
projects that qualify for a waiver of project review as described in B4-2.1-02, Waiver of Project Review, or condo projects reviewed under the Limited Review method as described in B4-2.2-01, Limited Review Process.
Coverage Requirements
When required, the HOA or co-op corporation must maintain a general liability insurance policy for the entire project. The general liability insurance policy must include coverage for:
commercial spaces that are owned by the HOA or co-op corporation, even if they are leased to others, and bodily injury and property damage that results from the operation, maintenance, or the use of the project's common elements, and any other areas that are under its supervision.
The general liability insurance policy must include a separation of insureds or severability of interests provision in its terms. If the policy does not include separation of insureds or severability of interests in its terms, Fannie Mae requires a speciﬁc endorsement to preclude the insurer's denial of a unit owner's claim because of negligent acts of the HOA or co-op corporation or of other unit owners.
Determining the Required Coverage Amount
The amount of coverage must be at least $1 million for bodily injury and property damage for any single occurrence.

Developments (12/14/2022)
Introduction This topic contains information on ﬁdelity/crime insurance requirements, including:
Determining if Fidelity/Crime Insurance is Required Coverage Requirements Determining the Required Coverage Amount Named Insured
Determining if Fidelity/Crime Insurance is Required
Fidelity/crime insurance is required for all condo and co-op projects, with the following exceptions:
projects that qualify for a waiver of project review as described in B4-2.1-02, Waiver of Project Review, condo projects reviewed under the Limited Review method as described in B4-2.2-01, Limited Review Process, condo or co-op projects consisting of 20 units or less, or condo or co-op projects that would need ﬁdelity/crime insurance coverage of $5,000 or less (based on the calculations described in Determining the Required Coverage Amount).
Coverage Requirements
When required, the HOA or co-op corporation must have ﬁdelity/crime insurance coverage for the dishonest or fraudulent acts of anyone who either handles or is responsible for funds held or administered for the HOA or co- op corporation. Fidelity/crime insurance is required whether or not that individual receives compensation for services rendered. Accordingly, the HOA or co-op corporation ﬁdelity/crime insurance policy must include coverage for the acts of any management agent.
Published February 5, 2025
871
A management agent that handles funds for the HOA or co-op corporation should additionally be covered by its own ﬁdelity/crime insurance policy, however, a ﬁdelity/crime insurance policy maintained by the management agent (with the management agent as the named insured) is not an acceptable alternative for a ﬁdelity/crime insurance policy in the HOA or co-op corporation's name that provides coverage for the acts of all parties with access to their funds, including the management agent.
Determining the Required Coverage Amount
When ﬁdelity/crime insurance is required, the lender or servicer must review the project legal documents or other source acceptable to the lender or servicer to verify whether the HOA or co-op corporation and any associated management company adhere to one or more of the ﬁnancial controls listed below:
Separate bank accounts are maintained for the working account and the reserve account, each with appropriate access controls, and the bank in which funds are deposited sends copies of the monthly bank statements directly to the HOA or co-op corporation. The management company maintains separate records and bank accounts for each HOA or co-op corporation that uses its services, and the management company does not have the authority to draw checks on, or transfer funds from, the reserve account of the HOA or co-op corporation. Two members of the Board of Directors must sign any checks written on the reserve account.
The following table describes how to determine the minimum required amount of ﬁdelity/crime insurance.
If the HOA or co-op corporation

Publication of Legal Documents
Fannie Mae publishes Legal Documents on its website. These legal documents include security instruments, notes, riders and addenda, and special-purpose documents that should be used in connection with regularly amortizing, conventional, residential mortgage loans sold to Fannie Mae. Many of these forms are published jointly by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and are referred to as Uniform Instruments.
Each legal document published on Fannie Mae's website is accompanied by a Summary or Instructions

document, which provides:
the latest revision date for the document,
the document’s purpose and type of mortgage transactions for which it is used,
instructions on how to print the electronic version of the document,
speciﬁc changes that must be made to the document,
additional changes that may be made to the document, and
other pertinent information about special circumstances that may aﬀect the user or completion of the document.
Legal Documents for Government Mortgages
A lender should use legal documents for regularly amortizing FHA-insured mortgages, VA-guaranteed mortgages, RD-guaranteed mortgages, and HUD-guaranteed mortgages that are acceptable to the government agency and are appropriate for the state in which the security property is located.
Although Fannie Mae does not publish documents for government mortgages, in some cases Fannie Mae allows (or requires) its legal documents to be used. If a lender chooses to use Fannie Mae’s legal documents for conventional mortgages, and if those documents must be modiﬁed or amended to comply with applicable government agency requirements, the following requirements must be met:
The documents must be enforceable under their terms.
The documents must comply with all applicable state and local requirements for a recordable and enforceable document.
The lender must make nonstandard document warranties that are similar to those Fannie Mae requires for other mortgages closed on documents other than Fannie Mae’s standard documents. See A2-2-03, Document Warranties.

Published February 5, 2025

B8-2-01, Security Instruments for Conventional Mortgages
(02/06/2019)
Introduction This topic contains general information on conventional ﬁrst mortgage security instruments, including:
Use of Security Instruments Standard First-Lien Mortgage Security Instruments Master Form and Short Form Documents
Use of Security Instruments
Lenders must use security instruments for conventional mortgages that are correct for the applicable jurisdiction, mortgage type, lien type, property type, and transaction type. Security instruments for regularly amortizing mortgages include the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Uniform Mortgages, Deeds of Trust, and Security Deeds.
In some cases, the uniform security instruments may have to be adapted to meet the lender’s needs or local jurisdictional requirements. If, however, a security instrument is modiﬁed in any way, Fannie Mae will consider it to be a nonstandard document, which means the lender’s delivery of the loan is subject to Fannie Mae’s requirements for nonstandard documents. For more information on the warranties a lender makes when it sells Fannie Mae mortgages closed on nonstandard documents, see A2-2-03, Document Warranties.
Standard First-Lien Mortgage Security Instruments
The current versions of the Fannie Mae standard ﬁrst mortgage security instruments are posted on Fannie Maes's Legal Documents website. The website also contains instructions for use of these documents, including any required changes and some changes that may be made at lender’s option, called “authorized changes.” Lenders must make sure that any changes they make, including changes authorized by Fannie Mae, comply with all applicable laws.
The standard uniform security instruments are used for almost all types of regularly amortizing mortgages. In some instances, the standard security instruments must be modiﬁed by a rider. For example, a rider is needed for an adjustable-rate mortgage as well as for a security property that is a one-unit dwelling that is used as a second home or an investment property, or that is a two- to four-unit property or a unit in a PUD or condo project. For more information about these riders, see B8-4-01, Riders and Addenda.
Master Form and Short Form Documents
Lenders may elect to deliver ﬁrst-lien mortgage loans to Fannie Mae using a master form mortgage or deed of trust (“Master Form”) and short form mortgage or deed of trust (“Short Form”) in states with statutes that allow for the use of these forms. The uniform Master Form and Short Form documents may be used in lieu of the current version of the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac uniform ﬁrst mortgage security instruments.
Published February 5, 2025
875
Under applicable state law, lenders may record a Master Form in a given recording jurisdiction, and then may subsequently record a Short Form for any mortgage loan originated in that jurisdiction.
The Master Form consists of a title page, which contains the state-speciﬁc requirements for a master security instrument, and the current long form uniform security instrument for that state. The Short Form contains the loan-speciﬁc information (for example, borrower name, lender name, loan amount, description of property, etc.) and identiﬁes the provisions of the Master Form that are being incorporated into the Short Form. Any applicable riders to the security instrument must be attached to the Short Form. The borrower must execute the Short Form document and any applicable riders. The lender must provide the borrower with a copy of the recorded Master Form as well as the signed Short Form and any applicable riders.
The documents are available for 27 states and are posted on Fannie Mae's Legal Documents website.

Introduction This topic contains general information on special-purpose security instruments, including:
General Information Consolidated New York Mortgages Puerto Rico Direct Mortgage Instruments Security Instruments for Manufactured Home Mortgages
General Information
Fannie Mae sometimes allows special-purpose alternative documents to be used in lieu of (or in addition to) the typical security instruments. These documents can be found on Fannie Mae's Legal Documents website. Authorized changes that must or may be made to those documents are set out in the instructions that accompany each document. These instruments must be supported by the appropriate mortgage riders, rider addenda, mortgage assignments, and, if applicable, other product-speciﬁc documentation (see B8-4, Riders and Addenda, and B8-6, Mortgage Assignments).
Published February 5, 2025
876
Consolidated New York Mortgages
The statutory provisions of New York permit reﬁnance mortgages (and sometimes purchase money mortgages) to be documented by a consolidation, extension, and modiﬁcation agreement (CEMA) that consolidates into one document the terms of prior notes and mortgages related to the security property and, if new funds are advanced, the terms of a new note and mortgage. In such instances, the consolidation must be documented on Fannie Mae’s standard Consolidation, Extension and Modiﬁcation Agreement (Form 3172), along with any accompanying exhibits Fannie Mae may specify. If new funds are advanced, Fannie Mae’s standard security instrument must be used to document the new mortgage that is being consolidated with the prior mortgages.
Puerto Rico Direct Mortgage Instruments
The statutory provisions of Puerto Rico permit a mortgage transaction to be documented by a single instrument that combines the terms of a note and mortgage. This is referred to as a “direct” mortgage. Fannie Mae does not publish standard legal documents for direct mortgages; therefore, lenders must develop (or acquire) appropriate documentation for these mortgages consistent with the applicable Puerto Rico statutes. By delivering a direct mortgage to Fannie Mae, the lender must make the nonstandard document warranties. (See A2-2-02, Delivery Information and Delivery-Option Speciﬁc Representations and Warranties.)
Security Instruments for Manufactured Home Mortgages
Fannie Mae prefers lenders to use the standard Fannie Mae uniform instruments for manufactured home loans sold to it.
Loan documents are not acceptable if they:
state that the home is personal property or contain other words to that eﬀect;
state that the parties do not intend to attach the home to a permanent foundation system on the land, or contain statements inconsistent with that intention;
unless required by law, provide that rights of holders in due course are waived, or with other words provide that an assignee note holder may be held liable for claims the borrower may have against other parties; or
include consumer ﬁnance paper (which combines the note and security instrument in a single document) or a retail installment sales contract.
The following list provides the requirements for the security instrument used for a manufactured home loan.
The property description section of the security instrument must include a comprehensive description of the manufactured home and the land. The description must include the serial or VIN number (or the serial number or VIN for each unit if the home is multi-width), make, model, size, and any other information that may be required by applicable law to deﬁnitively identify the home. The serial number is located on the HUD Data Plate located on the interior of the home, usually near the electrical box. In addition, the serial number is generally cold stamped on the frame front cross member of each transportable section.
Published February 5, 2025
877
Some jurisdictions may not allow any information in the property description section of the security instrument other than what is customary for other real property transactions. If this is the case, then an addendum may be used, which must be attached to the security instrument and included in the loan ﬁle.
The security instrument must state that the manufactured home is an improvement to the land and an immovable ﬁxture, or must include similar language as may be required by applicable law to assure, to the greatest extent possible, that the manufactured home is treated as real property under applicable state law. If applicable law provides speciﬁc obligatory wording, such wording must be used.
The borrower(s) and any lender with a personal property security interest in the manufactured home must sign an Aﬃdavit of Aﬃxture that acknowledges their intent for the manufactured home to be permanently part of the real property that secures the mortgage free of any personal property security interest. It must also contain any speciﬁc language that may be required by applicable law.
The Aﬃdavit must be signed by both the lender and the borrower(s), preferably recorded, and must be retained in the loan ﬁle.
Failure to include the Aﬃdavit of Aﬃxture in the loan ﬁle may result in the loan being ineligible for delivery to Fannie Mae.
If state law requires a Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) ﬁling in order to perfect a security interest in a manufactured home, the lender must make such ﬁling in any and all appropriate locations.

Borrowers’ Signatures on Security Instruments
The following person(s) must sign the security instrument:
Each person who has an ownership interest in the security property, even if the person’s income is not used in qualifying for the loan.
The spouse or domestic partner of any person who has an interest in the property, if their signature is necessary under applicable state law to waive any property right they have by virtue of being the owner’s spouse or domestic partner.
Signature Requirements: Powers of Attorney and Guardianship
The following persons may sign security instruments on a borrower’s behalf:
An attorney-in-fact may sign the security instrument, as long as the lender obtains a copy of the applicable power of attorney. In jurisdictions where a power of attorney used for a signature on a security instrument must be recorded with the security instrument, the lender must ensure that recordation has been eﬀected. See B8-5-05, Requirements for Use of a Power of Attorney, for further requirements governing the use of a power of attorney.
A court-appointed guardian may sign the security instrument if the borrower is not legally competent, provided that they have unlimited power over the ward’s aﬀairs, including the power to hold, convey, and give a lien against real property owned by the ward, to make payments from the ward’s assets, and to permit inquiries concerning the ward’s credit. The lender should obtain a copy of the documents making the appointment. If the guardian in some other capacity is a party to the loan or sale transaction—for example, the seller of the property—the lender should ascertain that there are no material conﬂicts of interest.

Use of Conventional First Mortgage Notes
Lenders should use the note that is correct for the applicable mortgage type, lien type, property type, and product type for regularly amortizing conventional mortgages that are closed on the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac uniform security instruments.
Fannie Mae publishes state-speciﬁc ﬁxed-rate notes for ten jurisdictions (although they are not available for all products). The multistate note can be used in most jurisdictions unless the security property is located in a jurisdiction for which Fannie Mae publishes a state-speciﬁc mortgage note.
The various notes that are used for ﬁxed-rate mortgages may be found on Fannie Mae's Legal Documents website. Authorized changes that must or may be made to these documents are set out in the instructions that accompany each document.
Adjustable-Rate Mortgage Notes
Generally, notes for adjustable-rate mortgages apply to speciﬁc ARM plans. Fannie Mae does not publish state- speciﬁc notes for all ARM plans. If Fannie Mae does not publish state-speciﬁc documents for a particular ARM plan, the lender must use the multistate note for that particular ARM plan and amend it as necessary to satisfy the requirements of the jurisdiction in which the security property is located. Required amendments may be incorporated by reprinting the amended documents, adding addenda to the documents, or making the changes on the documents themselves. The various notes that are used for ARMs may be found on Fannie Mae's Legal Documents website. Authorized changes that must or may be made to these documents are set out in the instructions that accompany each document.

Late Charges for Conventional Mortgages Requirement for Unit Number Mandatory Arbitration
Late Charges for Conventional Mortgages
The note for a conventional ﬁrst mortgage must include information about the late charge to be assessed for any payment that is not received by the 15th day after it becomes due. The amount of the late charge must meet the following requirements:
The amount must be permissible under applicable law.
The late charge must be a minimum of 0% and up to 5% of the principal and interest (P&I) payment.
Requirement for Unit Number
If the subject property is a condo or other property type that is identiﬁed by a unit number, the unit number must be included in the property address on the note.
Mandatory Arbitration
Mandatory arbitration is a loan provision or an agreement accompanying the loan that requires the borrower to submit to arbitration any disputes arising out of or relating in any way to the mortgage transaction. Mortgages that are subject to mandatory arbitration are ineligible for sale to, or securitization by, Fannie Mae unless the mandatory arbitration provision provides that, in the event of a transfer or sale of the mortgage or an interest in the mortgage to Fannie Mae, the mandatory arbitration clause immediately and automatically becomes null and void and cannot be reinstated.
The lender must provide the borrower with written notice of the waiver provision within 60 days of the transfer or sale of the mortgage to Fannie Mae. That notice must contain substantially the following language:
Pursuant to your mortgage documents, Fannie Mae is hereby notifying you that an interest in your loan has been transferred or sold to Fannie Mae and therefore the mandatory arbitration clause of your

An individual who is a co-signer or guarantor and who does not have an ownership interest in the property must sign the note, but is not named in (or required to sign) the security instrument.
When an inter vivos revocable trust is permitted by B2-2-05, Inter Vivos Revocable Trusts as a mortgagor, and no individual borrower has an ownership interest in the property (either on title or by operation of law), the trust must execute the note, but may do so without recourse for the exclusive purpose of subjecting its interest in the property to the lien of the mortgage. See B8-5-02, Inter Vivos Revocable Trust Mortgage Documentation and Signature Requirements for more information about the

documentation requirements for mortgages granted by inter vivos revocable trusts, including appropriate forms of signature for the note.
A borrower’s signature should not contradict the name typed below the signature line on the note. Slight variations are acceptable—a missing initial, the omission of a “Jr” or “Sr,” or an over- or under-signing (such as a borrower signing as William Thomas Smith when the typed name is William T. Smith, or vice versa). Signiﬁcant variations—such as William Smith signing as “Skip” Smith, signing with an “X,” or signing under an “also known as” name—are not acceptable unless the lender obtains a name aﬃdavit from the borrower stating that they commonly use the alternative signature.
Signature Requirements: Powers of Attorney and Guardianship
The following persons also may be eligible to sign the note on a borrower’s behalf in accordance with the guidelines below.
An attorney-in-fact may sign the note. See B8-5-05, Requirements for Use of a Power of Attorney, for further requirements governing the use of a power of attorney.
A court-appointed guardian may sign the note if the borrower is not legally competent, provided that they have unlimited power over the ward’s aﬀairs, including the power to hold, convey, and give a lien against real property owned by the ward, to make payments from the ward’s assets, and to permit inquiries concerning the ward’s credit. The lender should obtain a copy of the documents making the appointment. If the guardian in some other capacity is a party to the loan or sale transaction—for example, the seller of the property—the lender should ascertain that there are no material conﬂicts of interest.

Note Endorsement Using an Allonge for the Endorsement Signature Requirements for Endorsements
Published February 5, 2025
883
Note Endorsement
The originating lender must be the original payee on the note, even when MERS is named as nominee for the beneﬁciary in the security instrument. The note must be endorsed to each subsequent owner of the mortgage unless one or more of the owners endorsed the note in blank. The last endorsement on the note should be that of the mortgage seller. The mortgage seller must endorse the note in blank and without recourse.
For example:
PAY TO THE ORDER OF WITHOUT RECOURSE LENDER’S NAME (Authorized Signature) NAME OF AUTHORIZED SIGNER TITLE OF AUTHORIZED SIGNER
Using an Allonge for the Endorsement
The endorsement must appear on the note. An allonge may be used for the endorsement as long as the following requirements are met:
The form and content of the allonge used must comply with all applicable state, local, or federal law governing the use of allonges and result in an enforceable and proper endorsement to the note.
The allonge must be permanently aﬃxed to the related note and must clearly identify the note by referencing at least the name of the borrower(s), the date of the note, the amount of the note, and the address of the security property.
The note must clearly reference the attached allonge.
Fannie Mae’s status as a “holder in due course” must not be impaired.
Any subsequent endorsements should be, but are not required to be, placed on the allonge.
The lender must indemnify Fannie Mae (as described in A2-1-03, Indemniﬁcation for Losses) for any losses incurred by Fannie Mae as a result of the use of an allonge for the note endorsement(s).
Signature Requirements for Endorsements
The endorsement should be signed only by those persons speciﬁcally authorized to execute documents in the lender’s behalf. Signatures must be original, except that Fannie Mae accepts a lender’s facsimile endorsement of notes for those jurisdictions in which the lender has determined that such endorsements are valid and enforceable.
A lender that chooses to use facsimile signatures to endorse notes must warrant that the endorsement is valid and enforceable in the jurisdiction(s) in which the security properties are located and must retain in its corporate records the following speciﬁc documentation authorizing the use of facsimile signatures:
legal opinions related to the legality and enforceability of facsimile signatures for each jurisdiction in which the lender uses them;
Published February 5, 2025
884
a resolution from the lender’s board of directors authorizing speciﬁc oﬃcers by name or title to use facsimile signatures, stating that facsimile signatures are a valid and binding act on the lender’s part, and authorizing the lender’s corporate secretary to certify the validity of the resolution, and the names or titles of the oﬃcers authorized to execute documents by using facsimile signatures, and the authenticity of specimen forms of facsimile signatures;
the corporate secretary’s certiﬁcation of the authenticity and validity of the board of director’s resolution;
a notarized certiﬁcation of facsimile signature, which includes both the facsimile and the original signatures of the signing oﬃcer(s) and each oﬃcer’s certiﬁcation that the facsimile is a true and correct copy of their original signature.
The mortgage seller may not delegate to an attorney-in-fact its authority to execute an endorsement. The endorsement may not be executed by a party using a power of attorney.

B8-4-01, Riders and Addenda (06/05/2018)
Introduction This topic contains information on riders and addenda, including:
General Information Uniform Riders and Fannie Mae-Speciﬁc Riders to Security Instruments
General Information
Published February 5, 2025
885
There are special conditions that require modiﬁcation of a security instrument (usually by a rider) or a note (usually by an addendum). These conditions may relate to the type of borrower (inter vivos revocable trusts), the type of security property (units in project developments, multiple-dwelling units, and leasehold estates), the occupancy status of the property (second homes or investment properties), the amortization method used for the mortgage (adjustable-rate mortgages), or the type of mortgage product (HUD Section 184 mortgages that are combination construction/permanent mortgages, or HomeStyle Renovation mortgages).
Uniform Riders and Fannie Mae-Speciﬁc Riders to Security Instruments
There are uniform Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac riders to security instruments, as well as some Fannie Mae-speciﬁc riders. There are also some situations in which Fannie Mae requires a rider to security instruments, but Fannie Mae has not developed a speciﬁc form. In some cases, Fannie Mae may oﬀer language that a lender may include in the rider, even though Fannie Mae did not develop a speciﬁc document.
The various riders that are used for regularly amortizing ﬁrst mortgages may be found on Fannie Mae's Legal Documents website. Authorized changes that must or may be made to these documents are set out in the Summary Page that accompanies each document.
Security instruments must be amended by one or more uniform riders or Fannie Mae-speciﬁc riders, as applicable, including:

General Information
Fannie Mae has specialized mortgage loan documentation that a borrower must execute to ensure that any required additional responsibilities, obligations, or rights of the borrower, the lender, or a third party are set out in legal documents that are separate and apart from the security instruments, notes, and riders that are typically used for mortgages delivered to Fannie Mae. These specialized legal documents are required for:
mortgages to inter vivos revocable trusts,
co-op share loans,
Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans,
HomeStyle Renovation mortgages,
second mortgages that are part of a Community Seconds transaction, and
loans secured by community land trust properties.

Execution and Signature Requirements Signature Requirements When the Borrower is Individual and Inter Vivos Revocable Trust is Mortgagor Trustee Exclusion from Personal Liability Deﬁning the Responsible Borrower in an Inter Vivos Revocable Trust Requirements for Revocable Trust Riders Requirements for Amended Security Instrument Requirements for Standard Security Instrument and No Rider Indemniﬁcation
Execution and Signature Requirements
The note must be executed in accordance with E-2-04, Signature Requirements for Mortgages to Inter Vivos Revocable Trusts. The trustee(s) of the inter vivos revocable trust also must execute the security instrument and any applicable rider.
Each individual establishing the trust whose credit is used to qualify for the mortgage must acknowledge all of the terms and covenants in the security instrument and any necessary rider, and must agree to be bound thereby, by placing their signature after a statement of acknowledgment on such documents.
Any other party that Fannie Mae requires to sign either the mortgage note or the security instrument also must execute the applicable document(s).
E-2-04, Signature Requirements for Mortgages to Inter Vivos Revocable Trusts, includes the form of signature for the trustee(s) and the statement of acknowledgment for each individual establishing the trust whose credit is used to qualify for the mortgage.
Signature Requirements When the Borrower is Individual and Inter Vivos
Published February 5, 2025
889
Revocable Trust is Mortgagor
When one or more inter vivos revocable trusts eligible under B2-2-05, Inter Vivos Revocable Trusts hold title to the mortgaged property (alone or with another eligible inter vivos revocable trust), only an individual who is both grantor and primary beneﬁciary of one of the trusts may be a borrower and must sign the note in their individual capacity. In addition, each inter vivos revocable trust, acting through its trustee(s), is required to sign the note in connection with its grant of the mortgage. The inter vivos revocable trust may sign the note without recourse so that its liability for repayment of the note is limited to its interest in the mortgaged property. Such non-recourse status does not aﬀect or otherwise limit the personal liability of the individual establishing the inter vivos revocable trust under the note, and is in addition to the limitations on personal liability for certain trustees of inter vivos revocable trusts in the Selling Guide.
When an individual borrower has a direct ownership interest in the property, no other person (including a trust) is required to sign the note (except other borrowers).
Trustee Exclusion from Personal Liability
Certain trustees may request exclusion from personal liability under the mortgage instruments. Lenders may agree to such requests, subject to the following conditions:
Institutional trustees and individual trustees (other than individuals serving as trustees who both established the trust and whose credit is used to qualify for the mortgage) may be excluded from personal liability under the security instrument.
Institutional trustees and individual trustees (other than individuals serving as trustees whose credit is used to qualify for the mortgage, including individuals who established the trust) may be excluded from personal liability under the mortgage note.
Lenders that agree to modify the mortgage instruments to include an exclusion from personal liability are responsible for ensuring that the modifying language:
pertains only to the relevant trustee,
does not impair the note holder’s power to foreclose, and
does not in any way release from liability any individual trustee who is not identiﬁed above as being permitted to be released from liability.
Deﬁning the Responsible Borrower in an Inter Vivos Revocable Trust
Exhibit E-2-03, Revocable Trust Rider (Sample Language), includes sample language for a revocable trust rider. This rider (or a similar one appropriately modiﬁed to reﬂect the requirements of speciﬁc states) avoids ambiguities for mortgages made to inter vivos revocable trusts by clarifying who is considered to be “the borrower” with respect to any given covenant in the security instrument.
Instead of using a revocable trust rider, the lender may either:
amend the security instrument to include appropriate deﬁnitions and language similar in substance to
Published February 5, 2025
890
Fannie Mae’s sample rider, or
use the standard security instrument without such an amendment or the rider.
Requirements for Revocable Trust Riders
If the lender chooses to require a revocable trust rider as additional mortgage documentation, the rider must be:
executed by the trustee(s) of the inter vivos revocable trust and by any other party that Fannie Mae requires to sign the security instrument, and
acknowledged by each individual establishing the trust whose credit is used to qualify for the mortgage.
If the mortgage is secured by a California property, the lender should use Fannie Mae’s sample rider. If the mortgage is secured by property located in another state, the lender should use a rider that has been appropriately modiﬁed to reﬂect the requirements of that state (unless the lender determines that use of Fannie Mae’s sample Revocable Trust Rider is appropriate for the speciﬁc state).
Should foreclosure proceedings have to be initiated for a mortgage secured by a property located in a state other than California, the lender must indemnify and hold Fannie Mae harmless against any losses incurred by Fannie Mae that relate either
to the modiﬁcations the lender made to the Fannie Mae sample rider (or to the inappropriate use of the Fannie Mae sample rider), or
to any ambiguity in the application of the covenants in the security instrument.
Alternatively, Fannie Mae may require the lender to repurchase the mortgage or the acquired property.
Requirements for Amended Security Instrument
If the lender chooses to amend the security instrument instead of using a revocable trust rider, it should follow Fannie Mae’s instructions regarding parties who must sign the security instrument, including having only the individuals establishing the trust whose credit is used to qualify for the mortgage sign a statement of acknowledgment of the security instrument.
The lender must indemnify and hold Fannie Mae harmless against any losses incurred by Fannie Mae that relate either to the lender’s amendment or to any ambiguity in the application of the covenants in the security instrument should foreclosure proceedings later have to be initiated to acquire the property. Alternatively, Fannie Mae may require the lender to repurchase the mortgage or the acquired property.
Requirements for Standard Security Instrument and No Rider
If the lender chooses not to amend the security instrument and not to use the revocable trust rider, it must agree to indemnify and hold Fannie Mae harmless against any losses incurred by Fannie Mae that relate to any ambiguity in the application of the covenants in the security instrument should foreclosure proceedings later have to be initiated to acquire the property. Alternatively, Fannie Mae may require the lender to repurchase the
Published February 5, 2025

Indemniﬁcation
The lender’s obligation to indemnify Fannie Mae as noted above is further described in A2-1-03, Indemniﬁcation for Losses.

HomeStyle Mortgage Documentation Requirements
This section describes Fannie Mae’s requirements for security instruments, notes, riders, and addenda for HomeStyle Renovation mortgages. In addition, Fannie Mae has developed other model documents for use in connection with HomeStyle mortgages. Because these documents are model documents, they may need to be amended for certain types of lenders or particular types of transactions.
HomeStyle Mortgage
The mortgage or an appropriate rider to the security instrument (“renovation loan rider to security instrument” or “security instrument rider”) must
grant the lender a security interest in any personal property (including building materials) located in, or on, or used, or intended to be used, in connection with the work, and
provide that a borrower default under the renovation loan agreement must constitute a default under the security instrument and the note, and
grant the lender an assignment of rents as additional security for the loan and the right to appointment of a receiver of rents if the property is held for rental purposes.

B8-5-04, Sample Legal Documents (02/05/2025)
Introduction This topic provides documentation requirements for the following:
Subsidized Second Mortgages in Community Seconds Transactions Mortgages Secured by Property Located on Community Land Trusts
Subsidized Second Mortgages in Community Seconds Transactions
Fannie Mae has not developed legal documents for the second mortgage component of a Community Seconds transaction; rather, the subsidized second mortgage should be closed on documents developed or acquired by the subsidy provider. Second mortgage loans delivered to Fannie Mae must meet Fannie Mae requirements or have received prior approval on a negotiated basis.
A lender’s review of the legal documents should concentrate on determining that the security instrument for the subsidized second mortgage—and any other covenants or restrictions on the borrower’s ability to sell the property or to use the land that the subsidy provider has recorded, or may later record against the property—are clearly subordinate to the ﬁrst mortgage lien.
The legal documents also must set forth any and all conditions that constitute a default under the terms of the subsidized second mortgage.
Conditions that Fannie Mae considers acceptable include the borrower’s:
failure to make scheduled payments due on the mortgage;
failure to occupy the property as a principal residence;
misrepresentation of any condition required for obtaining the mortgage (such as whether the borrower satisﬁes any applicable income limitations);
payoﬀ of the ﬁrst mortgage;
reﬁnancing of the ﬁrst mortgage to cash out their equity in the property;
selling or transferring the property to a party that is ineligible to receive the subsidy (although property transfers that are exempt from enforcement of due-on-sale provisions under federal law must be allowed even if the party acquiring the property is not eligible for the subsidy, subject to the party’s assumption of the borrower’s obligations); and
voluntary termination of their employment (for any reason other than disability), if their employer is the subsidy provider.
If other default provisions are included in the legal documents for the ﬁrst or second mortgage, the borrower
Published February 5, 2025
893
and the subsidy provider must execute a rider to nullify or amend those provisions.
See Section B5-5.1, Community Seconds, for more information.
Mortgages Secured by Property Located on Community Land Trusts
Mortgages secured by properties located on a community land trust are subject to a ground lease, which includes provisions that require the continued use of the property for low- and moderate-income families, and limits the maximum sales price of the property.
For such loans, Fannie Mae requires the lessor and the borrower to execute a Community Land Trust Ground Lease Rider.
The purpose of the rider is to ensure the ground lease conforms to Fannie Mae’s guidelines for community land trust loans without the delay that would result from the lender’s obtaining Fannie Mae’s approval of each ground lease. Fannie Mae’s approval is required, however, if the rider is modiﬁed or is not executed. See B5-5.3-02, Shared Equity Transactions: General Requirements , for more information.

(05/04/2022)
Introduction This topic contains information on the authorized use of intervening and blanket assignments, including:
Intervening Assignments Blanket Assignments Special Provision for Puerto Rico
Intervening Assignments
If the originating lender is not servicing the loan at the time of the sale to Fannie Mae, then unless the loan has been registered with MERS or the loan is secured by a property in Puerto Rico, the seller of the loan must cause to be recorded one or more intervening assignments of mortgage to ensure there are eﬀective mortgage assignment(s) from the originating lender to the servicer. Copies of all such assignments must be retained in the loan ﬁle.
Blanket Assignments
Lenders may use blanket assignments for any intervening assignments that take place before the mortgage is sold to Fannie Mae, as long as this type of assignment is acceptable to the applicable recording jurisdiction (blanket assignments are assignments that cover more than one mortgage). Each blanket assignment must relate to a single recording jurisdiction.
The lender may be required to indemnify Fannie Mae (as described in A2-1-03, Indemniﬁcation for Losses), for any losses incurred by Fannie Mae due to the lender’s failure to obtain, record (if applicable), and retain the necessary intervening assignments. Alternatively, Fannie Mae may require the lender to repurchase the mortgage or the security property.
Special Provision for Puerto Rico
Assignments of mortgages generally are not recordable in Puerto Rico. Therefore, no intervening assignments need to be prepared, recorded, or retained in the individual mortgage loan ﬁle.

Chapter B8-7, Mortgage Electronic Registration System
(MERS)
Introduction
This chapter provides information related to mortgage loans registered with MERS.
B8-7-01, Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS), Inc.
(05/01/2024)
Introduction The MERS system is an electronic system that assists in the tracking of loans, servicing rights, and security interests. To initiate the electronic tracking, the seller/servicer assigns a special MERS Mortgage Identiﬁcation Number (MIN) to the loan and registers it in MERS. This topic contains information about MERS, including:
Naming MERS as the Nominee for the Beneﬁciary in the Security Instrument Requirements for the Use of MERS in Speciﬁed Geographic Areas MERS Registration Use of the MIN Mortgage Assignment to MERS Termination of MERS
Naming MERS as the Nominee for the Beneﬁciary in the Security Instrument
A seller/servicer that wants to register a newly originated loan with MERS may prefer to designate MERS as the nominee for the beneﬁciary in the security instrument. Doing so, eliminates the need for a subsequent assignment of the security instrument should the seller/servicer sell (or transfer servicing of) the loan to another seller/servicer that is a member of MERS. In such cases, the applicable security instrument must be modiﬁed to:
Published February 5, 2025
899
show MERS as the nominee for the seller/servicer,
deﬁne and name the originating seller/servicer, and
obtain the borrower’s acknowledgment of MERS’ role in the mortgage transaction.
If the seller/servicer encounters a situation where Fannie Mae is the owner of record for a loan because the original assignment of the loan to Fannie Mae was recorded in the public records, the seller/servicer must correct the error before it completes the MERS registration by:
preparing an assignment of the loan from Fannie Mae to MERS,
sending the assignment to Fannie Mae for execution, and
recording the assignment in the public records.
Changes that must be made to create a standard MERS security instrument for each jurisdiction may be found in the Instructions document for each state-speciﬁc security instrument (see Fannie Mae's Legal Documents website), with the exception of loans secured by property located in certain geographic areas, as described below.
The seller/servicer is responsible for the accurate and timely preparation and recordation of the security instrument and any MERS-related documents required to be used in speciﬁc geographic areas. Sellers/servicers must also take all reasonable steps to ensure that information pertaining to MERS is updated and accurate at all times.
Even when MERS is named as the nominee for the beneﬁciary in the security instrument, it has no beneﬁcial interest in the mortgage. All actions that MERS takes with respect to a loan are based on the instructions initiated by the originating seller, Fannie Mae, or the servicer. The originating seller remains responsible for all of its Contractual Obligations and any liability that it or Fannie Mae incurs as a result of the MERS registration, any MERS transaction, or the failure of MERS to perform any obligation with respect to a MERS-registered loan. In addition, the seller/servicer is solely responsible for any failure to comply with the provisions of its MERS Member Agreement, Rules, and Procedures.
Requirements for the Use of MERS in Speciﬁed Geographic Areas
MERS Rider
In the states listed below, sellers/servicers must use the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. Rider (MERS Rider) (Form 3158) when a newly originated loan will be registered with MERS. Sellers/servicers must also follow the Instructions to the MERS Rider and the applicable security instruments to make changes to the standard security instruments for the following states:
Montana,
Oregon, and
Washington.
As the MERS Rider must be used in these speciﬁed states, post-closing assignments to MERS are prohibited.
MERS Assignment Form - Maine
Published February 5, 2025
900
In the state of Maine, sellers/servicers must use the MERS Mortgage Assignment (Form 3749) to assign loans to MERS at origination or post-closing, as applicable. Loans in which the Maine security instrument has been modiﬁed to name MERS as the original mortgagee of record, solely as nominee for the seller/servicer, are ineligible for delivery to Fannie Mae.
MERS Registration
If a seller/servicer registers a loan on the MERS system before delivering it to Fannie Mae, the seller/servicer must ensure that the MIN is registered in MERS and names itself as the investor. Additionally, the seller/servicer must include the MIN in the delivery data. After Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes the mortgage, Fannie Mae notiﬁes MERS to update its records to reﬂect Fannie Mae’s ownership interest in the loan.
Note: For loans registered in MERS iRegistration where MERS is not named as the nominee for the beneﬁciary in the security instrument, the MERS MIN should not be reported on the loan schedules, unless the loan is an eMortgage registered on MERS eRegistry.
If a seller/servicer registers a mortgage with MERS after Fannie Mae has purchased or securitized the loan, the seller/servicer must name Fannie Mae as the investor during registration and notify MERS of Fannie Mae’s ownership interest in the loan.
Use of the MIN
For each MERS-registered loan delivered to a document custodian, the seller/servicer must indicate the MIN on the security instrument and related documents. Because the status of a MERS-registered mortgage can change, the seller/servicer is not required to include the MIN on the note. Additionally, the seller/servicer is still responsible for making sure that the document custodian has suﬃcient information to determine whether a loan that is included in a subsequent transfer of servicing is registered with MERS at the time of the transfer. The seller/servicer must have adequate controls in its processes to enable it to readily identify MERS-registered mortgages.
The seller/servicer can choose from the following options:
place the MIN on the note when the loan is registered with MERS and, if the MERS registration is subsequently terminated for any reason, notify the document custodian to delete the MIN from the note;
wait to advise the custodian of the status of the MERS registration for a loan until a change in status actually occurs; or
notify the custodian about the status of the MERS registration for a loan at the time of a servicing transfer by providing the custodian with a listing of all MERS-registered loans that are included in the transfer and a certiﬁcation that any and all other loans included in the transfer are not currently registered with MERS. (The listing may be prepared by the seller/servicer or, with the seller/servicer’s authorization, by MERS.) If there are more MERS-registered loans included in the transfer than there are unregistered loans, the listing may instead identify the unregistered loans—and, in that case, the certiﬁcation should state that any and all other loans included in the transfer are currently registered with MERS.
Mortgage Assignment to MERS
Published February 5, 2025
901
If the originating seller/servicer is the beneﬁciary for a loan that it registers with MERS, they must prepare an assignment of the mortgage to MERS. Refer to the section above, entitled Requirements for the Use of MERS in Speciﬁed Geographic Areas, for additional information about, and restrictions on, assignments of loans to MERS.
By delivering a MERS-registered loan to Fannie Mae, the seller/servicer:
warrants that MERS is the mortgagee of record (either by being named as an assignee in a recorded assignment of the security instrument or as nominee for the beneﬁciary in the security instrument); and
warrants that the MIN is valid and properly registered in MERS naming the seller/servicer as the investor.
Sellers/servicers are not required to include a copy of the assignment of the loan to MERS in the delivery package they submit to the applicable document custodian.
Termination of MERS
If the seller/servicer decides to discontinue the use of MERS, they must request from MERS that the loan be “deactivated” in MERS. MERS will notify Fannie Mae about the deactivation of any loan in which it has an interest.
If the seller/servicer’s membership in MERS is terminated, the seller/servicer must promptly notify Fannie Mae’s MERS Program Oﬃce (see E-1-02, List of Contacts).
In the event that either its membership in MERS or the MERS registration for an active loan is terminated for any reason while Fannie Mae has an ownership interest in the loan, the seller/servicer must perform the functions outlined in the following table for each MERS-registered loan that it is servicing for Fannie Mae.
✓
The seller/servicer must...
Prepare an assignment of the loan from MERS to itself.
Have the assignment executed.
Record the executed assignment in the public land records.
Provide the impacted Fannie Mae loan numbers to Fannie Mae’s MERS Program Oﬃce.

Chapter B8-8, Sale of eMortgages to Fannie Mae
Introduction
This chapter provides information related to selling eMortgages to Fannie Mae.
B8-8-01, General Information on eMortgages (12/13/2023)
Introduction This topic contains general information on eMortgages, including:
Overview Technology Requirements eMortgage Legal Requirements eMortgage Eligibility eMortgage Electronic Signatures Delivery of eMortgages to Fannie Mae Sale of Third-Party Originated eNotes Servicing
Overview
An eMortgage is a loan for which the promissory note and possibly other documents (such as the security instrument and loan application) are created and stored electronically rather than by traditional paper documentation that has a pen and ink signature. Because some recording jurisdictions will not yet accept electronic documents for recordation, eMortgages may consist of a paper security instrument and an electronic note (eNote).
Published February 5, 2025
903
This topic provides general information on the requirements for the origination and sale of one- to four-family eMortgages that Fannie Mae will purchase and securitize. See A2-1-01, Contractual Obligations for Sellers/Servicers for special approval requirements for sellers and servicers of eMortgages. Additionally, the eMortgage Technical Requirements are incorporated into the terms of the lender's Mortgage Selling and Servicing Contract, as amended by the eMortgage Addendum.
Technology Requirements
Each lender must use an eNote technology provider that has completed integration testing with Fannie Mae (see eClosing Technology Service Provider List). The lender is responsible for determining that the technology provider meets the legal, technological, and operational requirements necessary to electronically create valid and enforceable mortgage obligations and/or eﬀectively service eMortgages and that it otherwise complies with Fannie Mae's requirements (which may be in addition to minimum statutory requirements). A lender cannot use any other software technology or any other technology provider without the express written prior approval of Fannie Mae. Lenders must inform Fannie Mae prior to making substantial technology changes including changes to eNote or eVault technology providers to ensure changes are coordinated with Fannie Mae systems.
The lender must ensure that it has executed all tests required by Fannie Mae and that all systems and processes necessary to deliver and/or service eMortgages pursuant to this Guide and the MERS eRegistry requirements, are fully operational, including, systems integration among the lender, Fannie Mae and MERS.
eMortgage Legal Requirements
The lender makes all of the following representations and warranties with respect to each eMortgage sold to and, where applicable, serviced for Fannie Mae:
Each eMortgage is evidenced by an eNote that is a valid and enforceable Transferable Record Pursuant to the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act ("UETA"), or the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act ("ESIGN"), as applicable, and there is no defect with respect to the eNote that would confer upon Fannie Mae, or a subsequent transferor, less than the full rights, beneﬁts and defenses of Control (as deﬁned by the UETA and ESIGN) of the Transferable Record. Prior to transfer to Fannie Mae, the lender is an entity entitled to enforce the eMortgage and, subject to C1-2-04, Delivering eMortgages to Fannie Mae, is named the Controller (the person having control of the Transferable Record) on the MERS eRegistry; and, except as provided in that topic, the lender's right to sell or assign is not subject to any other party's interest or to an agreement with any other party. All electronic signatures associated with the eMortgage are authenticated and authorized. The lender has established procedures and controls limiting access to the lender's eMortgage delivery platform and the MERS eRegistry to duly authorized individuals, and Fannie Mae is entitled to rely on any transmission, transfer or other communication via these systems to be the authorized act of the lender. Any transfers of Control of the eNote are authenticated and authorized. The Authoritative Copy (a single, unique, identiﬁable, and generally unalterable copy) of the eNote has not been altered since it was electronically signed by its issuers. There has been, at all times, one and only one Authoritative Copy of the eNote in existence, and all copies other than the Authoritative Copy are readily identiﬁable as non-authoritative copies. The eNote is not subject to a defense, claim of ownership or security interest, or claim in recoupment of any party that can be asserted against the lender.
Published February 5, 2025
904
eMortgage Eligibility
Most conventional loans can be sold to Fannie Mae as eMortgages. This includes fully amortizing ﬁxed-rate and adjustable-rate loans. However, the following are not currently permitted to be sold as eMortgages:
loans for properties in Puerto Rico, loans to inter vivos revocable trusts, HomeStyle Renovation loans, New York CEMA loans, single-close construction-to-permanent loans, co-op share loans, and Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans.
The following transactions are eligible for sale as an eMortgage, but require supplemental documents for certiﬁcation. The supplemental document must be eDelivered to Fannie Mae's eVault along with the eNote.
notes executed with a power of attorney, RD-Guaranteed Section 502 loans, loans with a principal curtailment prior to purchase, and loans with temporary buydowns.
Loans with supplemental documents (required for certiﬁcation) other than those listed above are not eligible for sale to Fannie Mae as an eMortgage,
Other than the above eligibility restrictions, all other standard Fannie Mae underwriting and eligibility requirements apply to eMortgages.
eMortgage Electronic Signatures
By selling an eMortgage to Fannie Mae, the lender represents and warrants that the type of electronic signature that is used by the borrower to sign the eNote and any other electronic record associated with the transaction is legal and enforceable under applicable law and the electronic signature was not eﬀected by means of audio or video recording.
The systems and processes employed in the execution of an electronic signature, including clearly identifying the electronic record being signed, clearly displaying the borrower's name and requiring the borrower to take action to initiate the electronic signature. A single electronic signature cannot be applied to multiple electronic records simultaneously.
Delivery of eMortgages to Fannie Mae
For complete requirements for transfer of control, certiﬁcation and custody, and selling of eMortgages, refer to C1-2-04, Delivering eMortgages to Fannie Mae.
Sale of Third-Party Originated eNotes
Published February 5, 2025
905
Lenders selling eMortgages to Fannie Mae that were originated by a third-party broker or lender are responsible for establishing guidelines and procedures to ensure that the loans are created and maintained in accordance with the requirements of this Guide. Such guidelines and procedures must be furnished to Fannie Mae upon request and may be a requirement for eMortgage approval.
Servicing
For complete requirements for servicing eMortgages, refer to Fannie Mae's Servicing Guide.

B8-8-02, Requirements for Creating, Closing, and Correcting eNotes
(12/13/2023)
Introduction This topic contains additional requirements that are applicable to eNotes, including:
Uniform eNotes Record Retention Requirements Requirements for Registering eNotes Requirements for Correcting eNotes
Uniform eNotes
To be eligible for sale to Fannie Mae, eMortgages must be originated using the Uniform Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac form of eNote. This form of eNote is created by modifying the appropriate Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac uniform note in accordance with E-2-07, Description of eNote Header, Footer, and eNote Clause. Such modiﬁcation includes addition of a speciﬁc provision (Section 11, or Section 12 in the case of ARM eNotes) that addresses the electronic nature of the note. This special provision also includes reference to the MERS eRegistry. Immediately upon execution by the borrower, all eNotes must be registered on the MERS eRegistry and contain a valid, unique 18-digit Mortgage Identiﬁcation Number (MIN).
Published February 5, 2025
906
Fannie Mae requires creation of eNotes in the MISMO SMART Doc® format. For additional information, refer to Fannie Mae's eMortgage Technical Requirements.
Note: To ensure that the eNote is a discrete transferable record, closing instructions or other procedures must be created to ensure that the borrower signs only the eNote at closing and does not also sign a paper version of the Uniform note.
Record Retention Requirements
To preserve the lender's ability to attribute the signer's signature to their identity, certain documents and system records must be retained in a manner that will provide Fannie Mae with ready access to such documents and records if requested of the lender. For example, the lender must retain evidence of a borrower's identity in the loan ﬁle. The lender must collect and retain systems logs and audit trails that establish a temporal and process link between the presentation of identity documents and the electronic signing of a document. Additionally, the lender must collect evidence of a borrower's agreement to conduct the transaction electronically and their execution of a particular electronic signature.
All ﬁles must be retained for the life of the loan plus seven years. Any ﬁles that a lender maintains must include the following:
the name of the person (and related entity, if the borrower is not a natural person) who signed each document in the loan ﬁle, the date of the signature, the method by which the document was signed, and any relevant identifying (and other) information that can be used to verify the electronic signature and its attribution to the signer's identity.
Lenders must provide Fannie Mae with any audit trail ﬁles requested at any time in a format that is compatible with Fannie Mae systems. In the event of a servicing transfer, the lender is required to provide the new servicer with all attribution evidence and audit trails associated with the loans being transferred.
Requirements for Registering eNotes
The Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Uniform eNote provides that the Note Holder (as deﬁned in the eNote) will be the entity listed in the MERS eRegistry as Controller. Lenders must have process controls in place to ensure eNotes are registered in the MERS eRegistry as soon as possible after the tamper-evident seal has been applied, but no later than one business day after signing. The record in the MERS eRegistry must reﬂect the originating lender - the lender whose name is on the eNote - as the ﬁrst Controller. The following applies to lenders using tradenames or assumed names on eNotes:
the legal entity name must also be included on the eNote (for example, ABC Financial, Inc., dba XYZ Mortgage); and the initial MERS eRegistry registration must reﬂect the legal entity name as the initial Controller.
Any and all subsequent transfers of the eNotes - changes of Control - must be reﬂected in the MERS eRegistry. Failure to comply with these requirements could render the loan ineligible for sale to Fannie Mae. Refer to the MERS eRegistry requirements for detailed documentation.
Published February 5, 2025
907
Requirements for Correcting eNotes
eNotes containing errors will typically require that a new note be executed. In this instance, once the new note has been executed (either in ink-signed paper or as an eNote) the original eNote should be de-activated on the MERS eRegistry via a Registration Reversal transaction. For additional questions, lenders should contact Fannie Mae's eMortgage Group (see E-1-02, List of Contacts). If there are any issues identiﬁed with an eNote after it has been sold to Fannie Mae, the Servicer should contact Fannie Mae's eMortgage Custodian Oversight Department (see E-1-02, List of Contacts) to discuss resolution options.
eNote Errors Not Requiring a New eNote
The lender may amend an eNote via an eNote correction agreement, including a name aﬃdavit where applicable, executed by both the lender and the borrower, for the clerical errors noted in Exhibit E-2-06, Correcting Errors in eNotes. The eNote correction agreement must include a statement regarding the clertical errors that are being corrected within the eNote, and may be executed either electronically or via ink-signed paper. Fannie Mae does not prescribe a form of eNote correction agreement or provide a template, as lenders must ensure compliance with applicable legal requirements in the relevant jurisdiction. The lender is responsible for ensuring that the eNote correction agreement is enforceable and made in compliance with applicable law.
If the eNote correction agreement is electronic, the electronic signatures on the correction agreement must comply with the electronic signature requirements in B8-8-01, General Information on eMortgages. Regardless of whether the document is electronic or paper, the lender must:
report a "modiﬁcation" to the MERS eRegistry with respect to the eNote, transmit a copy of the correction agreement to Fannie Mae's eVault, and provide a copy of the correction agreement to the servicer to be maintained in the sevicing ﬁle.
For instructions related to post-acquisition eNote corrections, contact Fannie Mae's eMortgage Custodian Oversight Department (see E-1-02, List of Contacts).

Age of Loan
To be eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae on a ﬂow basis, a loan must be no more than six months old measured from the ﬁrst payment date to the "Purchase Ready" date (whole loans) or the MBS pool issue date (MBS loans). See B2-1.5-02, Loan Eligibility for additional information.
Published February 5, 2025

Volume Limitations
In conjunction with Section III. D of the Mortgage Selling and Servicing Contract, which provides that Fannie Mae is under no obligation to make a commitment to purchase any mortgage or participation interest from the lender, the following policies apply with regard to volume limitations:
Fannie Mae may establish, amend, or cancel any mortgage loan volume limitations speciﬁc to a lender, which may be applicable to aggregate whole loan deliveries and sales, deliveries and sales in exchange for MBS, or both.
Fannie Mae may also decline to engage in any speciﬁc transaction with a lender.
Volume limitations
may apply to volumes delivered on a daily, monthly, or quarterly basis, or as otherwise determined by Fannie Mae in its sole discretion, and any such limitation will supersede any higher daily limitation set forth in the Selling Guide ( C2-1.1-03, Mandatory Commitment Terms, Amounts, Periods and Other Requirements);
will apply even though the mortgage loans comply with all applicable provisions of the Selling Guide; and
will apply without regard to Fannie Mae’s conﬁrmation of any commitment taken by the lender in the whole loan or MBS committing application and/or other commitment.
Note: Any conﬁrmation made while a lender is over any such limitation or that would cause a lender to exceed such limitation may, at the option of Fannie Mae, be suspended or terminated, and the lender may be required to pair oﬀ such commitment(s).
Fannie Mae may impose volume limitations at any time, in its sole discretion, with no requirement that the lender be in default of any of its obligations under the Lender Contract. Fannie Mae’s decision not to impose volume limitations against a lender does not mean that Fannie Mae condones any action or inaction by the lender, or that Fannie Mae is waiving its right to impose any such limitations in the future. Volume limitations will be eﬀective when imposed, unless otherwise stated.
Whole Loan Commitments
Using Fannie Mae’s whole loan committing application, lenders can enter into a mandatory or a best eﬀorts commitment to sell whole loans to Fannie Mae for cash.
With a mandatory commitment, the lender agrees to deliver a speciﬁed dollar amount of loans, within certain tolerances, to Fannie Mae by a speciﬁed future date. Fannie Mae agrees to purchase those loans at an agreed-upon price. If a lender is unable to meet the terms of the agreement, it may have to pair oﬀ the commitment, which may require payment to Fannie Mae of a fee (called a pair-oﬀ fee) or the transaction may be eligible for a cash back pair-oﬀ. See C2-1.1-04, Mandatory Commitment Extensions and Pair-Oﬀs, for additional information.
With a best eﬀorts commitment, the lender agrees to deliver a speciﬁc loan to Fannie Mae by a speciﬁed date if that loan closes. If the loan does not close, the lender does not have to pay a fee. However, if the loan is closed, the lender must deliver the loan to Fannie Mae. If the lender changes the loan status to
Published February 5, 2025
911
“Closed” and then does not deliver the loan, Fannie Mae may assess a pair-oﬀ fee.
For additional information, see C2-1, Mandatory and Best Eﬀorts Commitments to Sell Whole Loans.
MBS Commitments
Using Fannie Mae’s MBS committing application, lenders can enter into mandatory commitments to sell MBS loans to Fannie Mae.
With an MBS commitment, the lender agrees to sell a certain volume of mortgage loans having a speciﬁed set of loan parameters to Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae provides the lender with guaranty fee pricing for such mortgage loans for delivery under MBS execution. If a lender is unable to meet the terms of the commitments, it has the option to roll or pair oﬀ the commitments, which may require payments to Fannie Mae of a fee (referred to as a “roll fee” or “pair-oﬀ fee”).
For additional information, see C3-2-04, Mandatory MBS Commitments.
Pooling Loans Into a Fannie Mae Trust for MBS
Lenders can obtain pool purchase contracts that enable them to sell Fannie Mae pools of loans with similar characteristics. In exchange, Fannie Mae will issue an MBS backed by those loans. MBS can be created for either swap-and-hold or swap-and-sell transactions. With a swap-and-hold transaction, the lender holds the security after it is created; whereas with a swap-and-sell, the security is immediately sold to other investors.
Minimum submission amounts (by aggregate issue date principal balance) required are:
ﬁxed-rate mortgage loans, single-lender pools: $1 million
adjustable-rate mortgage loans, single-lender pools: $500,000
Fannie Majors, multiple-lender pools: $1,000. (Fannie Majors pools in aggregate must meet the minimum amounts noted above to be opened.)
For additional information, see Subpart C3, Mortgage Backed Securities.
Bulk Transactions Options
In addition to selling their current production on a ﬂow basis, lenders can sell a wide variety of closed loans to Fannie Mae under MBS or whole loan transactions. For bulk transactions, lenders must contact their Fannie Mae customer account team or the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk to determine what type of contract to use for MBS deliveries.
Pricing and Fees
When lenders commit to sell whole loans for cash, Fannie Mae provides a “live” price, so named because prices move throughout the day, generally in tandem with the MBS market. Live pricing options for mandatory whole
Published February 5, 2025
912
loan commitments and best eﬀorts commitments are posted within Fannie Mae’s whole loan committing application.
Lenders that participate in Fannie Mae’s MBS program pay Fannie Mae a guaranty fee remittance each month as compensation for the right to do so. Factors used to calculate the guaranty fee remittance rate include the credit risk of loans included in the pool, the servicing option that applies to each loan in the pool, and the remittance cycle that applies to the pool. The speciﬁc guaranty fee applicable to an MBS loan is set forth in the related MBS commitment between Fannie Mae and the lender.
Note: Any pricing changes that are directed by Fannie Mae’s regulator will not aﬀect the base guaranty fee reﬂected in any existing commitment unless required by the regulator. If this occurs, the lender will have the option of canceling any commitments that could be aﬀected by the base guaranty fee change, with no pair-oﬀ, roll or extension fees due from the lender.
Lenders that elect to trade their MBS can obtain price indications by contacting Fannie Mae’s Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk (see E-1-02, List of Contacts) or via various ﬁnancial information service providers. Prices are based on pass-through rates, maturities, and other factors.
Loan-Level Price Adjustments
For both whole loan and MBS transactions, Fannie Mae may apply one or more loan-level price adjustments (LLPAs) based on certain loan-level credit risk characteristics, such as credit score, loan purpose, occupancy, number of units, and product type. All LLPAs are cumulative. LLPAs are applied according to the following:
Whole loans: LLPAs are calculated on the "Purchase Ready" date (as reﬂected in Loan Delivery) based on the unpaid principal balance of the loan. All applicable LLPAs will be deducted from the purchase proceeds. Loans in MBS: LLPAs are calculated on the MBS pool issue date based on the pool issue balance. All applicable LLPAs will be drafted from the lender's account designated for that purpose.
Fannie Mae may also waive LLPAs for certain transactions.
Lenders may be eligible for an LLPA refund on certain loans repurchased by the lender, as determined by Fannie Mae in its sole discretion. The refund will be calculated based on the LLPAs charged at acquisition less a processing fee of 50 basis points of the unpaid principal balance at acquisition. If the total of all LLPAs paid by the lender for a loan is 50 basis points or less, Fannie Mae will not refund the LLPA. The LLPA refunds are available only for loans originally delivered as whole loans and repurchased within 18 months of acquisition by Fannie Mae. The refunds will be issued to the responsible party for the selling representations and warranties as a separate transaction (independent from the repurchase transaction) in the month following the completion of the repurchase.
For a current listing of LLPAs (and waivers), see the Loan-Level Price Adjustment (LLPA) Matrix.
Premium Pricing Recapture for Whole Loans and Early Payoﬀ Reimbursement for MBS
With respect to any loan that pays oﬀ within 120 days from the whole loan purchase date or the MBS issue date, as applicable, Fannie Mae, in its sole discretion, may require reimbursement from the lender associated with the
Published February 5, 2025
913
purchase of the loan.
For a whole loan, the reimbursement is the premium, or the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the par price (100% of the face value) multiplied by the UPB of the loan at the time of purchase. At Fannie Mae’s sole discretion, the reimbursement may be reduced by the amount equal to the total of all LLPAs paid in connection with delivery of a loan less a processing fee of 50 basis points based on the UPB at acquisition.
For a loan repurchased by a lender, Fannie Mae, in its sole discretion, may require reimbursement by the lender for any premium paid in connection with the purchase of the related repurchased loan without regard to the 120–day limitation.
For a loan a lender delivers as part of an MBS swap transaction, the early payoﬀ reimbursement will consist of 100 basis points (1%) of the loan's issue balance at the time of securitization plus any buyup proceeds paid by Fannie Mae.
No Assignment of Whole Loan or MBS Commitments
For information on assignment of Fannie Mae whole loan or MBS commitments see A2-1-01, Contractual Obligations for Sellers/Servicers.

Introduction
Published February 5, 2025
914
Many of the “good delivery” requirements for delivering loans in fulﬁllment of a whole loan commitment diﬀer from those associated with a commitment to pool loans into an MBS. This chapter provides information about the delivery requirements that these executions have in common.
C1-2-01, General Information on Delivering Loan Data and
Documents (05/01/2019)
Introduction This topic provides general information on a lender’s obligation to supply data and documentation of all loans submitted to Fannie Mae for purchase, including:
Timing and Deadlines Delivery Tolerances Loan Qualiﬁcations Receiving Sale Proceeds or Securities
Timing and Deadlines
A lender can begin to deliver loans against its commitments as soon as it receives a commitment conﬁrmation number for whole loans, or an MBS commitment contract number for MBS loans. The lender must deliver the loans required to fulﬁll the commitment prior to the commitment expiration date. Speciﬁcally, lenders must submit loan data electronically, via Loan Delivery, and send the documentation package to the document custodian.
Fannie Mae may reject a loan for a variety of reasons, including failure to meet Fannie Mae’s eligibility requirements, incomplete or inaccurate loan delivery data, or incomplete document submission packages. Fannie Mae may assess a late delivery fee for loans that are redelivered after a commitment has expired. See C2-2-01, General Requirements for Good Delivery of Whole Loans, and C2-2-02, Documentation Requirements for Whole Loan Deliveries, for information concerning whole loan data and document delivery requirements and C3-7-04, Delivering MBS Pool Data and Documents, for information concerning data and document delivery requirements for loans in MBS pools.
Delivery Tolerances
For both whole loan and MBS deliveries, lenders may deliver an amount slightly higher or lower than the original commitment amount, without charge. For information on delivery tolerances speciﬁc to whole loan sales and MBS transactions, see C2-1.1-02, General Information about Mandatory Commitment Pricing and Fees, and C3-7-03, Making Good Delivery.

Loan Qualiﬁcations
Lenders must ensure that all loans selected for delivery meet Fannie Mae’s underwriting and eligibility guidelines and legal requirements. The loan terms must also match the terms of the commitment, including mortgage type, amortization, original term, and pass-through rate(s) selected for delivery when the commitment was created.
Receiving Sale Proceeds or Securities
When Fannie Mae purchases loans in fulﬁllment of a whole loan execution, it does so by sending funds via wire transfer to an account designated by the lender for this purpose. For MBS transactions, Fannie Mae issues securities to the lender, if the lender has elected to hold the securities in its portfolio, or to the investor designated by the lender, if the lender has sold the securities before it delivers the loans to Fannie Mae. If the lender has elected to use an “original issue” settlement to fund a forward trade through Fannie Mae’s Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk (see E-1-02, List of Contacts), the securities will be assigned directly to Fannie Mae. For details speciﬁc to the two types of transactions, see C2-2-03, General Information on Whole Loan Purchasing Policies, and C3-7-06, Settling the Trade, respectively.

Electronic Submission via Loan Delivery
Data for all loans must be electronically transmitted to Fannie Mae using Loan Delivery. Loan Delivery is a web- based application that allows lenders to deliver whole loans for purchase and MBS loans for securitization to Fannie Mae. Lenders can import loan and pool data, perform edits to facilitate error-free delivery, transfer loans between commitments (or pools), track the status of loan deliveries, generate reports, and export loan and pool data back to the lender’s organization.
Loans may only be submitted and purchased in Loan Delivery if they are clear of all fatal edits. Loans are subject to all fatal edits in Loan Delivery throughout the submission, loan documentation certiﬁcation and acquisition purchase process. If a loan encounters a fatal edit, the fatal edit must be resolved for Fannie Mae to acquire the loan.
Loan Delivery Application Resources
For information regarding the Uniform Loan Delivery Dataset (ULDD) and the data delivery requirements, access the ULDD page on Fannie Mae’s website. The Fannie Mae Implementation Guide for Loan Delivery Data, Appendix D: Fannie Mae XML Data Reference, provides a listing of the ULDD required and conditionally required data ﬁelds, as well as ﬁeld deﬁnitions and implementation notes. For additional guidance on ULDD, refer to the following resources available on the ULDD page:
Frequently Asked Questions,
ULDD Speciﬁcation, and
General and Technical Implementation Resources.
Resources speciﬁc to the Loan Delivery application that support the delivery of the ULDD data can be found on the Loan Delivery page on Fannie Mae’s website. This page includes links to various resources, including:
Loan Delivery Release Notes,
Loan Delivery Business Rules Dictionary, and
Loan Delivery Job Aids and User Guide (in Help & Training).
Seller/Servicer-Initiated Post-Purchase Adjustments
Lenders must notify Fannie Mae when
they determine there are discrepancies in the data attributes submitted to Fannie Mae at loan delivery and their loan records,
they did not submit housing goal attributes at loan delivery, or
the property address has been rezoned.
Published February 5, 2025
917
Lenders must follow the post-purchase adjustment process to resolve these matters. For additional information and instructions, see Fannie Mae's website. Also, see C2-2-05, Whole Loan Purchasing Process for additional information about reconciling the Purchase Advice and after sale corrections.
Lenders must submit data corrections within 18 months of the loan's acquisition date to be considered for repricing of loan-level price adjustments (LLPAs). A minimum $100 requirement per loan (credit or debit) is also required. The 18-month lookback period does not apply to the drafting or collection of repurchase alternative fees. Fannie Mae, in its sole discretion, may adjust the minimum dollar amount and lookback period at any time.
Special Feature Codes
Lenders must include speciﬁc special feature code(s) (investor feature identiﬁer) as part of the delivery data when delivering certain loans. Fannie Mae auto-derives certain special feature codes based on other data submitted. Auto-derived special feature codes are not required to be included in the lender’s delivery data. For a list of special feature codes, including those that are auto-derived, see Special Feature Codes.
If a lender fails to identify (or incorrectly identiﬁes on a consistent basis) any applicable special feature code(s) when they submit loans that require these codes in fulﬁllment of a whole loan commitment or for inclusion in an MBS pool, Fannie Mae may impose a compensatory fee. The amount of the fee will be based on:
the lender’s overall performance,
the lender’s explanation for their failure to comply,
previous instances of noncompliance,
the amount of any previous compensatory fee, and
any other factors Fannie Mae deems relevant.
For additional information about delivery of special feature codes, see the Special Feature Code section of the Loan Delivery/ULDD Job Aids.
Documentation Requirements
Documentation requirements will diﬀer based on the type of loans being delivered to Fannie Mae. For additional details, see C2-2-01, General Requirements for Good Delivery of Whole Loans, C2-2-02, Documentation Requirements for Whole Loan Deliveries, and C3-7-04, Delivering MBS Pool Data and Documents, respectively.
See the Fannie Mae Requirements for Document Custodians (RDC guide) for document delivery and certiﬁcation requirements.
Delivery of the Fannie Mae Loan Number to the Document Custodian
The lender is responsible for ensuring that the document custodian receives the Fannie Mae loan number for every loan within 30 days of loan certiﬁcation. The lender must respond within three business days to any request from the document custodian to provide the Fannie Mae loan number following the certiﬁcation of the related mortgage loan.
Published February 5, 2025

Additional Required Electronic Submissions
Appraisal Data
Lenders must electronically submit certain appraisal reports through the UCDP prior to the delivery of the loan. See B4-1.1-06, Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) and the Uniform Collateral Data Portal (UCDP) for details on these requirements.
Uniform Closing Dataset (UCD)
The UCD is a common industry dataset that allows information on the Closing Disclosure to be transmitted electronically to Fannie Mae. Lenders are required to electronically submit a UCD XML ﬁle of the loan to Fannie Mae and receive a “Successful” status from the UCD collection solution prior to the delivery of the loan. The UCD XML ﬁle must contain the borrower data and the PDF of the borrower Closing Disclosure. Lenders must submit the UCD XML ﬁle for all conventional loans, regardless of whether the TILA/Regulation Z Rule requires the Closing Disclosure, including non-owner-occupied property loans.

Introduction This topic provides information on the following:

Mortgage Loan Certiﬁcation Overview Control of Mortgage Notes During the Loan Certiﬁcation Processes Ownership Interest and Title to Mortgage Notes Conﬂicts Regarding Rights in Mortgages
Mortgage Loan Certiﬁcation Overview
The Fannie Mae certiﬁcation processes for whole loan and MBS deliveries are designed to assure Fannie Mae and the marketplace that all mortgage loans purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae conform to Fannie Mae’s requirements and are not subject to any liens or claims of any third parties. Therefore, it is in Fannie Mae’s interest that liens and claims in and to such notes are properly resolved as part of the loan pooling, certiﬁcation, and acquisition processes.
It is critical to Fannie Mae’s purchase or securitization of mortgage loans that Fannie Mae receives good delivery of loans that conform to Fannie Mae’s requirements and, if applicable, meet the characteristics attributed to them in MBS disclosures. Therefore, Fannie Mae requires that mortgage sellers deliver mortgage documents to document custodians for review and certiﬁcation prior to Fannie Mae’s purchase or securitization of the loans. Document custodians must review all documents to ensure that all of the required documentation has been received and conform to Fannie Mae’s requirements. Fannie Mae will not purchase whole loans or issue MBS until after it has received the document custodian’s certiﬁcation. The certiﬁcation will state that the custodian has examined and maintains physical custody and control of the required documents for the mortgages.
Control of Mortgage Notes During the Loan Certiﬁcation Processes
Fannie Mae recognizes that possession of notes is an important element of a note owner’s or secured lender’s protection of its rights. However, the nature of the whole loan purchase and MBS pooling and securitization processes requires that Fannie Mae, through its document custodian, obtains control of the notes as part of the certiﬁcation review process and maintains control through the completion of the purchase or securitization process. Fannie Mae cannot purchase whole loans or permit pools to close and securities to be issued without being assured of continued control of the underlying notes.
Fannie Mae does not assert that it obtains ownership or title to the notes during the certiﬁcation processes until such time as the purchase proceeds (cash or securities) for the certiﬁed loans are remitted pursuant to the terms of the purchase or securitization transaction. Any modiﬁcations or revisions to the terms of the notes or further physical movement of the notes during these processes are restricted; the certiﬁed documents must be “locked down” under the document custodian’s control prior to Fannie Mae’s remittance of the purchase proceeds. Fannie Mae recognizes that the legal rights of the mortgage seller delivering the notes (or, as applicable, of its warehouse lender) are unaﬀected by the certiﬁcation processes until Fannie Mae has remitted purchase proceeds.
Ownership Interest and Title to Mortgage Notes
Eﬀective upon the remittance of the purchase proceeds, Fannie Mae and/or its MBS trusts obtains and holds ownership and title to the notes and the notes will then be held by the document custodian on behalf of Fannie Mae. If the transaction fails to close as contemplated by the contract between Fannie Mae and the mortgage
Published February 5, 2025
920
seller and purchase proceeds are not wired, Fannie Mae claims no ownership interest in the notes and requires that the document custodian return the notes to the mortgage seller or its warehouse lender, as applicable.
Conﬂicts Regarding Rights in Mortgages
If Fannie Mae becomes aware of any issues in which the rights of another party might impair its unqualiﬁed title to any mortgages that are delivered to Fannie Mae (including but not limited to a bailee letter), then Fannie Mae will not be required to deliver the related purchase proceeds in accordance with the lender’s delivery instructions until the issue is resolved to Fannie Mae’s satisfaction and Fannie Mae receives adequate assurances that it will have unqualiﬁed title to the mortgages.
Fannie Mae will not be responsible for the consequences of any delay in the delivery of the proceeds that results from its having to resolve an issue related to title to the mortgages.
Fannie Mae has established procedures for resolving title issues presented by its receipt of a bailee letter. See C1-2-06, Bailee Letters for lender requirements and Fannie Mae’s Requirements for Document Custodians (RDC guide) for document custodian requirements.
These processes are intended solely to verify the accuracy of certain loan information delivered by the mortgage seller (and not to beneﬁt any third party). These procedures do not apply when the same corporate entity is both the warehouse lender claiming an interest and the document custodian because, by its execution of Fannie Mae’s Master Custodial Agreement, (Form 2017), the lender releases any interest it may have in the mortgage notes when it takes possession of them as Fannie Mae’s document custodian.

C1-2-04, Delivering eMortgages to Fannie Mae (12/13/2023)
Introduction This topic contains information about delivering eMortgages to Fannie Mae, including:
Overview Delivering eMortgages to Fannie Mae Using MERS eDelivery Requirements to Transfer Control and Location of the eNote to Fannie Mae Transfer of Control and Location to the Warehouse Lender eNote Control Transfer and Custodial Agreement
Published February 5, 2025
921
Certiﬁcation and Custody of eMortgages Loan Delivery Data
Overview
Lenders may deliver eMortgages for either whole loan or MBS execution. Fannie Mae accepts mixed MBS pools - ones that contain both paper notes and eNotes. eMortgages are delivered to Fannie Mae via the MERS eDelivery service. See MERS website for more information on MERS eDelivery.
Delivering eMortgages to Fannie Mae Using MERS eDelivery
The eNote and any documents required for certiﬁcation (for example, a power of attorney, if applicable) must be transmitted to Fannie Mae's eVault via MERS eDelivery (or direct eDelivery for customers using Fannie Mae's eVault provider). Fannie Mae will return an electronic approval message once the systems have accepted the document. Sellers are not required to use a document custodian to maintain other related loan documents unless otherwise required. For more information on delivering eMortgages, refer to Fannie Mae's eMortgage Technical Requirements.
Requirements to Transfer Control and Location of the eNote to Fannie Mae
After the eNote has been successfully delivered to Fannie Mae, lenders (or their warehouse providers) should transmit a request to the MERS eRegistry to begin the process of transferring Control and Location (the location of the eNote's current Authoritative Copy) of the eNote to Fannie Mae. A "Transfer of Control and Location" request must be transmitted to the MERS eRegistry to initiate the transfer of ownership and to update the MERS eRegistry to show Fannie Mae as the Controller and Location of the Authoritative Copy of the eNote. Lenders are expected to monitor the status of transfer requests to ensure they have been completed successfully. The transfer request must include an "Eﬀective Date" of the same day as the request. The Eﬀective Date is used by the MERS eRegistry to denote the date that the transfer must be complete. Fannie Mae requires that the MERS eRegistry records, for loans transferred to Fannie Mae, contain the Servicer's MERS Org ID (or sub-servicer, if applicable) in the "Master Servicer" ﬁeld on the eRegistry in order to enable that party to perform certain transactions within the MERS eRegistry). (Note: If the Master Servicer is changing coincident with the sale to Fannie Mae, the update to this ﬁeld can be completed after completing the Transfer of Control and Location to Fannie Mae.)
If prior to Fannie Mae purchasing the loan, the lender requires the eNote to be returned, the lender must submit a Request for Transfer of Control of eNotes (Form 2009e) to Fannie Mae's Custodian Oversight Department (see E-1-02, List of Contacts).
Transfer of Control and Location to the Warehouse Lender
Lenders may originate or purchase eMortgages using interim funding from a warehouse provider in a manner that establishes the warehouse provider as lienholder of each related eNote and that shows the warehouse provider as being in Control of each related eNote at eMortgage settlement or that reﬂects the warehouse provider as the "Secured Party" in the MERS eRegistry for the related eNote. In order to facilitate Fannie Mae's
Published February 5, 2025
922
purchase or securitization of an eMortgage in which a warehouse provider has a security interest, the warehouse provider must perform (or cause to be performed) one of the two following actions depending on whether the warehouse provider is named as the Controller or as the "Secured Party" of an eNote.
If the warehouse provider is in Control of an eNote prior to sale to Fannie Mae, the warehouse provider must transfer Control and Location of the related eNote to Fannie Mae, on the lender's behalf, using the warehouse provider's MERS Org ID for pre-purchase inspection, among other things. If the warehouse provider is named as the "Secured Party" in the MERS eRegistry on an eNote prior to sale to Fannie Mae, the warehouse provider must approve a Transfer of Control and Location to Fannie Mae that has been initiated by the lender, or the warehouse provider may itself (or through a designated agent) initiate a Transfer of Control and Location to Fannie Mae, on the lender's behalf. At the conclusion of such transaction, Fannie Mae will be named in Control and Location and there will be no named entity in "Secured Party".
Lenders and its warehouse providers must use Fannie Mae's Loan Delivery application, in accordance with their respective agreements with Fannie Mae, to submit or validate wiring instructions for the account to which purchase proceeds (in the form of cash or MBS) for eMortgages covered by such interim funding agreements should be delivered. Lender authorizes Fannie Mae to deliver the purchase proceeds (in the form of cash or MBS) for eMortgages in accordance with such wiring instructions.
eNote Control Transfer and Custodial Agreement
In connection with delivery of funded eMortgages to Fannie Mae, warehouse providers must enter into an eNote Control Transfer and Custodial Agreement with Fannie Mae in which, generally, Fannie Mae accepts control of delivered eNotes until such time as:
Fannie Mae makes payment and the warehouse provider releases its security interest, or Control of the eNotes is returned to the eRegistry participant that was previously in Control prior to Fannie Mae; provided that if there was a "Secured Party" named on the eNote prior to transfer to Fannie Mae, Fannie Mae will ﬁrst assign the applicable MERS Org ID to the "Secured Party" ﬁeld and then initiate the transfer. Lender authorizes Fannie Mae to take such actions.
If, before Fannie Mae buys any eMortgages, Fannie Mae receives written notice from a warehouse provider that warehouse provider has exercised its right to acquire the eMortgage because of a default, lender authorizes Fannie Mae to transfer Control and Location of the related eNote to warehouse provider (or its designee).
If Fannie Mae believes a party other than lender or the applicable warehouse provider has an interest in any eMortgage (or the related purchase price), lender agrees that Fannie Mae may, in its sole discretion, decline to purchase such eMortgage and notify lender and warehouse provider of such decision.
In return for Fannie Mae's accommodation of delivery of funded eNotes that are subject to warehouse lending arrangements and for Fannie Mae's performance of certain obligations under the eNote Control Transfer and Custodial Agreement that are in the lender's interest, the lender hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Fannie Mae against all Fannie Mae losses (as deﬁned in A2-1-03, Indemniﬁcation for Losses) arising or resulting from any act or omission of lender or Fannie Mae (except those arising or resulting from Fannie Mae's gross negligence or willful misconduct) made in connection with the terms of the eNote Control Transfer and Custodial Agreement.
Published February 5, 2025
923
Certiﬁcation and Custody of eMortgages
Fannie Mae provides in-house automated document certiﬁcation (auto-certiﬁcation) for eligible eNotes. For eNotes that cannot be auto-certiﬁed but are permitted to be sold to Fannie Mae, these will be routed for manual certiﬁcation by a document custodian. A document custodian interested in certifying eNotes on behalf of Fannie Mae must meet all of the eligibility requirements outlined in the Requirements for Document Custodians. Contact Fannie Mae's Custodian Oversight Department (see E-1-02, List of Contacts) for additional information on certifying eNotes on behalf of Fannie Mae.
Loan Delivery Data
Lenders must perform the following process in addition to delivering the eMortgage through MERS eDelivery:
Add the eNote Indicator ﬂag to the corresponding loan(s) in Fannie Mae's Loan Delivery application which identiﬁes the loan as an eMortgage loan; and Perform the usual whole loan or MBS delivery through Fannie Mae's Loan Delivery application.
NOTE: If for any reason an eMortgage must be transferred back to the lender (for example, in the event of an error on the loan or transferred in error), the lender must submit Form 2009e to Fannie Mae's Custodian Oversight and Monitoring Department to request the transfer (see E-1-02, List of Contacts).

Introduction This topic contains information about delivering Green MBS to Fannie Mae, including:
Overview Eligibility Requirements Loan Delivery Data
Published February 5, 2025
924
Overview
Fannie Mae's Green MBS consists of loans secured by properties that have received approved green building certiﬁcations within the last ﬁve years. An eligible green building certiﬁcation requires the home to be at least 10% more eﬃcient than a home built to an individual state's energy code. Lenders may deliver whole loans or MBS.
Eligibility Requirements
Green MBS loans are subject to standard Selling Guide requirements, including the following:
Loans may be ARMs or ﬁxed-rate. All property types are eligible. Refer to the Eligibility Matrix for applicable LTV, CLTV and HCLTV ratio requirements. The property must have one or more eligible green building certiﬁcations obtained within the last ﬁve years. See Single-Family Green MBS Certiﬁcations for a list of current organizations that meet our requirements.
For whole loans: The loan must be sold within ﬁve years of the property's certiﬁcation year. For loans in MBS: The pool must have a pool issuance year within ﬁve years of the property's certiﬁcation year.
Example: For a loan secured by a property with a green building certiﬁcation received in the year 2020, the loan must be sold to Fannie Mae by the end of 2025.
Loan Delivery Data
For a Green whole loan sale, lenders should contact their Fannie Mae Account Team (see E-1-02, List of Contacts).
For a Green MBS, lenders may use EarlyCheck or Loan Delivery to conﬁrm that all loans are Green MBS-eligible. To be considered a Green MBS, 100% of the loans in the MBS must be eligible.
One of the following special feature codes must be delivered in addition to any other SFCs that may apply to the transaction:

Introduction This topic provides information on bailee letters, including:
Bailee Letters Resolution of Mismatched Delivery Instructions Liability for Losses Incurred by a Mortgage Seller or any Other Party
Bailee Letters
Bailee letters typically state that:
the notes identiﬁed in the letter are pledged to the named third party,
the lien of the third party’s security interest will be released only if the proceeds from the transfer of the mortgages to Fannie Mae are delivered to the third party in accordance with the delivery instructions in the letter, and
the recipient holds the notes as a “bailee” (or in trust) for the third party until the third party either receives the proceeds (cash or securities) or receives back the notes for any mortgages that were not purchased or securitized.
The term “bailee letter” includes any communication that notiﬁes a document custodian of any of the following:
the notes are pledged to a third party;
the notes are subject to a security interest or lien held by a third party;
the notes are owned by, or titled in the name of, a third party (for example, mortgages that are subject to a sale and repurchase arrangement); or
the notes are subject to some other claim or interest held by a third party that would, if it were not released, result in Fannie Mae’s acquiring less than clear, unencumbered, and exclusive title to the mortgage notes.
The requirements for processing bailee letters and other notiﬁcation of third-party interests in mortgage loans can be found in Fannie Mae’s RDC guide.
Resolution of Mismatched Delivery Instructions
Fannie Mae will undertake to identify mismatches and to achieve matches in delivery instructions promptly, in good faith, and in accordance with reasonable business practices.

Liability for Losses Incurred by a Mortgage Seller or any Other Party
Fannie Mae will not be liable for any losses that a mortgage seller or any other party incurs as the result of Fannie Mae’s actions or omissions related to these procedures, including Fannie Mae’s execution of (or failure to execute) speciﬁc steps, and any resulting delay.
A mortgage seller is obligated to ensure that Fannie Mae takes free and clear title to the mortgages it delivers to Fannie Mae; therefore, it must make sure that its delivery instructions match those of its warehouse lender before it delivers the mortgage to Fannie Mae. Because of this obligation, the mortgage seller will be fully responsible for any trading or settlement delays (including those Fannie Mae experiences) that arise as the result of mismatches in delivery instructions. (See C3-7-06, Settling the Trade, for information on how to settle diﬀerent delivery instructions.) Further, the execution of these procedures will not constitute a waiver of any of the rights and remedies Fannie Mae has under the mortgage seller’s representation and warranty that the title to any mortgage note it delivers to Fannie Mae is free and clear of any security interest, lien, pledge, or other encumbrance.

Not all remittance types are available for all product types. For MBS mortgages, the only remittance type available is Scheduled/Scheduled.
After Fannie Mae purchases a mortgage, it generally will not change the remittance type the lender has selected. Refer to the applicable section of the Servicing Guide for more information about remittance types.
Actual/Actual
The Actual/Actual (A/A) remittance type is available for whole loans. It is required for HUD-guaranteed and Rural Development-guaranteed mortgages. Lenders must notify Fannie Mae immediately and remit the actual principal and interest collected from the borrower, net of servicing fees, to Fannie Mae.
Scheduled/Scheduled
The Scheduled/Scheduled (S/S) remittance type is available on a negotiated basis for whole loans, including ARMs, and fully amortizing ﬁxed-rate conventional monthly payment ﬁrst mortgages. It is required for MBS mortgages. Lenders remit scheduled interest (net of servicing fees) and scheduled principal due, whether or not payment is collected from the borrower.
Scheduled/Actual
The Scheduled/Actual (S/A) remittance type is available for whole loans. Lenders remit scheduled interest (net of servicing fees) regardless of actual collections from the borrower and actual principal collected the month following receipt of funds.

To obtain a mandatory commitment to sell whole loans to Fannie Mae, lenders may use Fannie Mae’s whole loan committing application, a free Web-based application available to subscribers, or may contact the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk (see E-1-02, List of Contacts). Lenders can obtain information on subscribing to the whole loan committing application by contacting their Fannie Mae customer account team or the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk, or by referring to Fannie Mae’s website.
Lenders can obtain commitments on any weekday, with the exception of bond market observed holidays as

Fannie Mae conﬁrms its acceptance of the lender’s request for a mandatory commitment by electronically transmitting a commitment conﬁrmation to the lender. If Fannie Mae is unable to process the electronic transmission, lenders are notiﬁed promptly. Should a lender have a problem receiving a commitment conﬁrmation, it should immediately contact the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk.
If the lender has obtained the commitment by contacting the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk, the legally binding terms of the commitment are captured in a recorded telephone conversation between the lender and the Desk.

Introduction This topic describes Fannie Mae’s pricing policies and practices, including:
Overview Pass-Through Rates Access to Pricing Up-front Commitment, Extension, Overdelivery, Pair-oﬀ and Other Fees Additional Resources
Overview
As noted in C1-1-01, Execution Options, when lenders commit to sell loans to Fannie Mae, Fannie Mae provides a “live” price, so named because prices move throughout the day, generally in tandem with the MBS market. Fannie Mae purchases regularly amortizing whole mortgages either at par (100% of the unpaid principal balance), at a discount, or at a premium, based on the type of mortgage being delivered and the pricing option speciﬁed in the whole loan commitment under which the mortgage is delivered.
Pass-Through Rates
For whole loans, the rate at which the lender must remit interest on the mortgages it sells to Fannie Mae via a mandatory commitment is the pass-through rate, deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the gross note rate and the servicing fee. Lenders can choose a range of ﬁve consecutive pass-through rates in increments of 0.125% under the same mandatory commitment. When obtaining a commitment, lenders specify the minimum pass-through rate. The lender does not need to know the exact interest rate of the mortgages that will be delivered in
Published February 5, 2025
930
fulﬁllment of the commitment as long as the pass-through rates fall within the selected range. The actual interest payments lenders will remit for regularly amortizing mortgages will depend on the remittance option selected by the lender.
Access to Pricing
Lenders obtain current pricing speciﬁc to their institution by accessing Fannie Mae’s whole loan committing application.
Access to both generic and lender-speciﬁc pricing information is available to approved Fannie Mae lenders and requires a valid user ID and password. For information on obtaining access to this information, lenders should contact their Fannie Mae customer account team or the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk.
Up-front Commitment, Extension, Overdelivery, Pair-oﬀ and Other Fees
Fannie Mae may charge up-front fees on commitments made to deliver adjustable-rate mortgages for which the lender has selected the scheduled/actual remittance option. See C1-3-01, General Information on Remittance Types, for more information on this remittance type.
Fannie Mae may charge lenders for lender-requested and automatic extensions for mandatory commitments (“extensions”), delivering more than the maximum delivery amount of their commitment (“overdelivering”), repurchasing all or part of a commitment (“pairing-oﬀ”), or otherwise failing to satisfy mandatory commitment requirements. These fees, if charged, are drafted from the lender’s designated account the business day following the assessment. If cash is due to the lender under a cash back pair-oﬀ, the lender’s designated account will be credited the business day following the pair-oﬀ. See below for account requirements.
Extension fees are based on three factors:
Amount to be extended, which equals the lender’s original commitment amount minus any deliveries as of the date of the extension, and, if the extension is a partial extension, minus any partial pair-oﬀ amount;
Actual number of days by which the commitment expiration date is being extended. (Note that if the request is for a 20-day extension and the 20th day falls on a weekend or holiday, the contract will be extended to the next business day.); and
Daily interest charge, which is based on the minimum pass-through rate posted on the original commitment.
For overdelivery and pair-oﬀ fees, including cash back pair-oﬀs, whole loan prices captured at commitment and again at the time of the overdelivery or pair-oﬀ are used to determine if a fee will be charged or if cash back is due and, if so, the amount. All pair-oﬀ amounts (including cash back pair-oﬀs) are calculated from the original commitment amount, not the low delivery tolerance.
A lender must designate a non-MBS P&I custodial account from which Fannie Mae can and will automatically draft and credit whole loan transaction and related fees that it owes, or is owed by, Fannie Mae. The bank instructions for the account must be established in the Cash Remittance System (CRS).
Fannie Mae will draft or credit, as applicable, up-front commitment, extension, overdelivery, and pair-oﬀ fees
Published February 5, 2025

from the lender’s designated account on the day following the request for the commitment, extension, overdelivery, or pair-oﬀ. Compensatory fees for failure to satisfy mandatory delivery requirements will be drafted from the designated account on the ﬁrst Friday after the expiration of the commitment period and any additional time allowed to eﬀect the delivery or a pair-oﬀ.
To ensure that funds related to borrower payments are not used to satisfy a lender’s corporate responsibility for the payment of fees or charges due Fannie Mae, a lender must make sure that its designated account will have suﬃcient funds on hand when Fannie Mae drafts it for the related fee. The lender must notify Fannie Mae immediately about changes to the status of its designated account to ensure Fannie Mae’s drafts are honored and protect the lender from being charged additional fees for late remittances.

C2-1.1-03, Mandatory Commitment Terms, Amounts, Periods and
Other Requirements (07/05/2023)
Introduction This topic identiﬁes the requirements for loans delivered against a whole loan commitment, including:
Required Common Loan Attributes Commitment Amounts Commitment Periods Borrower Payment Status Requirements Assignments, Sales and Transfers of Whole Loans Negotiated Commitments
Required Common Loan Attributes
All loans delivered against a whole loan commitment must share certain common attributes. These include:
Product type — See Mortgage Products for information about products eligible for sale to Fannie Mae.
Mortgage type — Conventional or government
Lien type — First mortgages
Amortization type — Fixed-rate or adjustable-rate
Mortgage term — 10-, 15-, 20-, or 30-year. Lenders may commit to deliver loans with nonstandard amortization terms or loans that exceed the maximum number of months for a given term by selecting the next highest amortization schedule available in Fannie Mae’s whole loan committing application, regardless of pricing option.
ARM plan number, if applicable
Remittance type
Commitment Amounts
Lenders may enter into multiple commitments but may not exceed $200 million in aggregate commitment volume per day. Lenders seeking permission to exceed this amount must contact the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk (see E-1-02, List of Contacts). Lenders exceeding the limit without Fannie Mae approval may be required to pair oﬀ their commitment(s) at the lender's expense.
There is no minimum commitment amount for mandatory whole loan commitments. Note that commitments are issued in multiples of $1.
Commitment Periods
Published February 5, 2025
933
Commitments to deliver most loan products can be taken for 1 to 90 days. Lenders should be sure to choose a commitment period that allows suﬃcient time after loan closing for the fulﬁllment of the lender’s shipping and delivery requirements. (See C2-2-01, General Requirements for Good Delivery of Whole Loans, and C2-2-02, Documentation Requirements for Whole Loan Deliveries, for details.)
Commitments are based on calendar days but must expire on a business day. Lenders can track the status of their commitments in Fannie Mae’s whole loan committing application.
Borrower Payment Status Requirements
The table below provides the requirements for payment status for loans delivered to Fannie Mae.
Transaction Type
Payment Status
12 or fewer months old at the time of delivery
The borrower must not have had any 30-day
delinquencies since the loan was originated.
The borrower must not have any 30-day
More than one year old at the time of delivery
delinquencies in the 12-month period that precedes
the lender’s delivery of the loan to Fannie Mae.
The payment status requirement applies to the
current borrower. However, for a seasoned loan, if the
Assumed
current borrower has owned the property less than 12
months, the time period is reduced to the number of
months that they have owned the property.
Assignments, Sales and Transfers of Whole Loans
By submitting a whole loan to Fannie Mae as a whole loan delivery, the lender represents, warrants, and agrees that all right, title, and interest in the mortgage is sold, transferred, set over, and otherwise conveyed by the lender to Fannie Mae as of the date of Fannie Mae’s funding of the purchase proceeds.
A lender may deliver a loan that has been originated by another lender. However, the selling lender must make all of the warranties speciﬁed in Fannie Mae’s Contract as if it were the originator. In such cases, the selling lender must be aware of all matters related to the loan that were known to the originating lender.
The lender may not assign Fannie Mae’s whole loan commitments except to obtain construction ﬁnancing or interim ﬁnancing under a “warehouse” line of credit. If the construction or warehouse lender intends to use the commitment or contract to deliver mortgages to Fannie Mae on its own behalf, it must be an approved Fannie Mae lender. It also must notify the lender’s Fannie Mae customer account team of the assignment before it delivers a loan to Fannie Mae.
Published February 5, 2025
934
Negotiated Commitments
Lenders that want to sell loans to Fannie Mae that contain unique eligibility and underwriting considerations not permissible for delivery via a standard commitment may request a negotiated commitment.
A variance between Fannie Mae and the lender is required when the lender is delivering whole loans via a negotiated commitment. Lenders should contact their Fannie Mae customer account team for details.

balances. For information on the fees associated with these activities, see C2-1.1-02, General Information about Mandatory Commitment Pricing and Fees.
Lender-Requested Commitment Extensions
Lenders may extend commitments on or before the original commitment expiration date for up to a maximum of 30 days from that date. They may request multiple extensions as long as the total extension period is no longer than 30 days. Each request must be made before the contract expiration date in eﬀect following the previous extension. See C2-1.1-02, General Information about Mandatory Commitment Pricing and Fees, for information on the fees associated with a lender-requested extension.
Lenders may extend the entire outstanding commitment balance or a portion of it, if the lender also requests a partial pair-oﬀ of the remaining balance. The sum of the extended amount and the paired-oﬀ amount must equal the total remaining commitment amount.
Lenders may request extensions in Fannie Mae’s whole loan committing application or through the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk between 8:15 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on any business day (see E-1-02, List of Contacts). All telephone conversations are voice-recorded. Lenders should maintain detailed records of the contract extensions requested.
Fannie Mae-Implemented (Automatic) Commitment Extensions
If a lender fails to meet Fannie Mae’s good delivery requirement within the original commitment period and has not previously extended the commitment, Fannie Mae will automatically extend it. Commitments expiring with outstanding unpaid principal balances will be automatically extended a minimum of ﬁve calendar days and assessed the appropriate extension fee. See C2-1.1-02, General Information about Mandatory Commitment Pricing and Fees, for information on the fees associated with an automatic extension.
If no deliveries have been made by the expiration of the ﬁve-day extension, Fannie Mae will eﬀect an automatic pair-oﬀ and the appropriate fee assessed and drafted from the lender’s designated account.
Lender-Requested Pair-oﬀs
A lender may purchase (pair oﬀ) all or part of a mandatory delivery commitment in the whole loan committing application or by contacting the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk between 8:15 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time), if it is unable to satisfy Fannie Mae’s minimum delivery requirement. The request can be made at any time between the date on which the commitment was executed and the date on which it expires. The lender can obtain a new quotation later, but before the commitment expiration date, to avoid an automatic extension and the possible assessment of an automatic pair-oﬀ fee.
After Fannie Mae veriﬁes the information required for calculating a pair-oﬀ fee, it will provide the lender with a fee quotation through either the whole loan committing application or through the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk. The quotation may be for a pair-oﬀ fee to be paid by the lender or, if the transaction is eligible for a cash back pair-oﬀ, it may be for an amount due to the lender by Fannie Mae. The lender must accept the quotation within a short time frame if it wants to exercise the pair-oﬀ. Conﬁrmation of the pair-oﬀ can be obtained in the whole loan committing application.
Published February 5, 2025
936
In conjunction with a lender-requested pair-oﬀ, if the whole loan price at commitment is greater than the price at the time of the pair-oﬀ solely as a result of market ﬂuctuations (and not from any other cause, including product-related pricing changes implemented by Fannie Mae), then Fannie Mae will not charge a lender a pair- oﬀ fee but will provide cash back to the lender (known as a cash back pair-oﬀ). The lender is not eligible for a cash back pair-oﬀ on a commitment if
the commitment gets paired oﬀ through the automatic pair-oﬀ process, and
the mortgage products delivered under the commitment are deemed by Fannie Mae, in its sole discretion, to be ineligible per the Selling Guide.
Additionally, negotiated transactions with the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk and commitments that exceed the daily volume limit may not be eligible for cash back pair-oﬀs.
Though lenders are generally eligible to receive cash back on pair-oﬀs upon approval to transact business in the whole loan committing application, Fannie Mae may decline to activate a lender for cash back pair-oﬀs if, in Fannie Mae’s sole discretion, the lender’s anticipated business strategy does not align with Fannie Mae’s use of the cash back pair-oﬀ process.
Additionally, if any of the following events occur, Fannie Mae may immediately terminate a lender’s eligibility for cash back pair-oﬀs:
Fannie Mae, in its sole discretion, determines that the lender is obtaining commitments without the intent to deliver;
there is any suspension of the lender’s selling privileges under the Master Selling and Servicing Contract (MSSC); or
the lender’s MSSC is terminated.
Termination will be eﬀective as to any new or outstanding commitments as of the eﬀective date of the termination.
Fannie Mae-Implemented (Automatic) Pair-oﬀs
Fannie Mae automatically pairs oﬀ the entire remaining commitment balance for any expired, unfulﬁlled mandatory commitment that has been previously extended, although Fannie Mae will ﬁrst process any mortgage deliveries pending in its purchase pipeline.

C2-1.1-05, Servicing Fees (05/01/2019)
Introduction This topic describes how Fannie Mae compensates lenders for servicing loans on its behalf, including:
Determining and Obtaining a Servicing Fee
Determining and Obtaining a Servicing Fee
A lender’s servicing compensation when obtaining mandatory commitments is described in its applicable servicing contract. Lenders must also specify a maximum allowable servicing fee, which may diﬀer, depending on the mortgage product. For example, the maximum servicing fee for all ﬁxed-rate loans is 50 basis points (.50%).
Unless otherwise provided in the related servicing contract, every month, lenders deduct their servicing fee from the borrower’s interest payment before remitting the remainder to Fannie Mae. Lenders will receive a servicing fee from Fannie Mae only for the period during which it serviced the loan on Fannie Mae’s behalf.
For additional information regarding minimum and maximum servicing fees, refer to Servicing Guide F-2-09, Servicing Fees for Portfolio Mortgage Loans.

Published February 5, 2025
938
Overview Accrued Interest Payments for Regularly Amortizing Mortgages
Overview
The amount of servicing fee Fannie Mae will pay lenders for servicing regularly amortizing mortgages delivered via a mandatory commitment depends on the remittance option the lender has selected. (See C1-3-01, General Information on Remittance Types, for descriptions of the remittance types.)
Accrued Interest Payments for Regularly Amortizing Mortgages
For A/A remittances, Fannie Mae purchases accrued interest from the last paid installment date for the mortgage up to, but not including, the purchase date. This interest adjustment is based on the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage at the time it is submitted for purchase and the designated pass-through rate of the mortgage (which is the lesser of the net note rate and Fannie Mae’s required yield for mortgages delivered under whole loan commitments that specify the standard pricing option). If interest is prepaid, Fannie Mae deducts accrued interest from the purchase proceeds.
For S/S remittances, Fannie Mae purchases accrued interest from the ﬁrst day of the purchase month up to, but not including, the purchase date. This interest adjustment is based on the scheduled unpaid principal balance for the mortgage as of the purchase date and the designated pass-through rate of the mortgage.
For S/A remittances, Fannie Mae purchases accrued interest from the ﬁrst day of the purchase month up to, but not including, the purchase date.

939
Commitment Timing, Pricing and Compensatory Fees for Converted ARM Resale Commitments
Standard ARM Mandatory Commitments
Lenders may take down mandatory whole loan commitments to deliver a variety of ARMs to Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae will purchase ARMs with varying initial ﬁxed rate periods and indexes.
See the Standard ARM Plan Matrix for parameters for ARM loans eligible for sale to Fannie Mae, including the initial ﬁxed interest rate period, interest rate adjustment frequency, indexes, and cap structure. Fannie Mae’s standard ARM program does not permit the purchase of ARMs with caps (“ﬂoors”) (other than the ARM’s margin) on the lifetime decreases to the life of the loan. The margin for each ARM delivered must include the same servicing fee speciﬁed in the commitment.
For additional information, see the Standard ARM Plan Matrix.
Minimum Commitment Amount for Converted ARM Resale Commitments
Converted ARM Resale mandatory commitments are used by lenders to redeliver ARMs that were originally in an MBS pool and have been converted to ﬁxed-rate whole loans.
Lenders must agree to deliver an amount (total UPB) equal to the outstanding balance of the mortgage to be delivered under the commitment. If the lender is delivering multiple mortgages with the same interest rate after conversion, the amount must equal the combined UPB of those mortgages.
Process for Converting an ARM within an MBS to a Fixed-Rate Mortgage
ARM loans with a conversion option are eligible for conversion to ﬁxed-rate mortgages. When a borrower chooses to convert an ARM currently in an MBS pool, the lender must follow these steps.
Step
Process for Converting the Mortgage
1.
Contact Fannie Mae to repurchase the mortgage from the MBS pool before interest begins
accruing at the new ﬁxed rate.
2.
Redeliver the mortgage to Fannie Mae as a whole loan (A/A remittance only), if the lender
speciﬁed a take-out post-conversion disposition option when it originally delivered the ARM.
3.
Continue any recourse or credit enhancement that initially applied to the mortgage unless the
lender and Fannie Mae agree otherwise.

Best Eﬀorts Commitment Process
Best Eﬀorts Commitment Process
To obtain a best eﬀorts commitment, lenders may use Fannie Mae’s whole loan committing application, a free Web-based application available to subscribers, or may contact the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk. Lenders can obtain information on subscribing to the whole loan committing application by contacting their Fannie Mae customer account team or the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk, or by referring to Fannie Mae’s website.
Best eﬀorts commitments may be made on weekdays between 8:15 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) with the exception of bond market observed holidays as deﬁned by SIFMA. After hours best eﬀorts committing is also available on weekdays until 10:00 p.m.
Fannie Mae conﬁrms its acceptance of the lender’s request for a best eﬀorts delivery commitment by providing a conﬁrmation to the lender that the loan has been committed.

Best Eﬀorts Commitment Pricing
Published February 5, 2025
942
As is the case with mandatory whole loan commitments, Fannie Mae oﬀers lenders a “live” price in Fannie Mae’s whole loan committing application as its purchase price for loans delivered via best eﬀorts commitments. Live prices move throughout the day, generally in tandem with the MBS market. Fannie Mae may charge fees or make pricing adjustments in conjunction with a best eﬀorts commitment. See also C1-1-01, Execution Options.
Best Eﬀorts Pair-oﬀ Fees and Duplicate Commitment Price Adjustments
Under the best eﬀorts commitment option, generally a pair-oﬀ fee will not be assessed for commitments that fallout due to:
cancellation of an applicant's rate lock, as long as the cancellation results from an applicant withdrawal or lender declination; or
a change to the product type or key data which results in a change of the committed loan from a loan eligible for a best eﬀorts commitment to a loan ineligible for a best eﬀorts commitment.
A pair-oﬀ fee will be assessed for commitments where the fallout event is due to a failure, for any reason, to deliver the closed and committed loan to Fannie Mae, including when a lender (or a third-party originator who originates in the lender's name) has solicited new pricing and committed or sold the loan to Fannie Mae or another investor.
Fannie Mae may cancel a commitment and charge a pair-oﬀ fee in the event the property address is missing or ﬁctitious or in the event the identical property address is used to enter into multiple commitments.
A duplicate commitment price adjustment will be assessed in the event a lender delivers a loan to Fannie Mae against any other (duplicate) commitment(s) for the same borrower and property address committed prior to or within 30 days of the original commitment's fallout or expiration date (the earlier of the two).
Best Eﬀorts Commitment Periods and Extension Fees
As is the case with mandatory commitments, best eﬀorts commitment periods may be as short as one day and as long as 90 days. Lenders may extend commitments on or before the original commitment expiration date for up to a maximum of 30 days for a fee. Lenders may request multiple extensions as long as the total extension period is not longer than 30 days. A best eﬀorts commitment with a “Closed” loan status will automatically extend for ﬁve calendar days until the loan is purchased or the commitment has been extended for a maximum of 60 calendar days from the original expiration date. After a commitment has reached its maximum allowed auto-extension period, the whole loan committing application will automatically pair oﬀ the “Closed” status commitment.
Fannie Mae will notify lenders via the whole loan committing application of fees associated with extending the commitment period. Once notice is given, payment of the fee becomes an absolute obligation.
Note: All committing fees and post purchase price adjustments will be drafted from the lender’s draft account with Fannie Mae. All draft fees can be viewed on Fannie Mae’s website.

Best Eﬀorts Commitment Terms and Amounts Best Eﬀorts Servicing Options Other Best Eﬀorts Requirements DU Recommendations on Loans Delivered with Best Eﬀorts Commitments
Best Eﬀorts Commitment Terms and Amounts
By accepting any prices and delivering mortgages to Fannie Mae pursuant to a commitment obtained through Fannie Mae’s whole loan committing application, the lender conﬁrms that:
the lender is approved and continues to satisfy the eligibility requirements as described in this Guide, and
the mortgages comply with all Fannie Mae requirements in the Mortgage Selling and Servicing Contract and the Selling and Servicing Guides.
Fannie Mae will commit to pay to lenders proceeds that are based upon the acquisition price for committed loans, subject to any applicable adjustments, as long as:
the key data and product type delivered matches the key data and product type reported to Fannie Mae to enter into the commitment, and
the acquisition date is on or before the date upon which the commitment expires.
Best eﬀorts commitments are for a speciﬁc borrower, address, and commitment period. Loan substitution is not allowed. Lenders may not change a best eﬀorts commitment to a mandatory commitment (or vice versa) or change the remittance type from scheduled/scheduled to actual/actual (or vice versa).
Lenders must notify Fannie Mae via the whole loan committing application within one business day of any change to the key data or product type that occurs during the commitment period. If there is a change to the
Published February 5, 2025
944
key data or product type and the new loan meets Fannie Mae’s eligibility requirements, the acquisition price for the committed loan may be changed to reﬂect the revised information (using worse case pricing when applicable).
Best Eﬀorts Servicing Options
Lenders may retain, release, or sell the servicing rights associated with the loans they deliver in fulﬁllment of a best eﬀorts commitment. Lenders may also execute a concurrent transfer of servicing via the whole loan committing application. If approved to participate in the Servicing Marketplace component of the whole loan committing application, lenders have the option to retain servicing or arrange for the concurrent sale of servicing to a participating servicer through the Servicing Marketplace. See C2-1.3-01, Servicing Marketplace, for more information.
Those retaining or releasing servicing may do so using the actual/actual or scheduled/scheduled remittance type. Certain products, however, require servicing via a speciﬁc remittance type. See C1-3-01, General Information on Remittance Types, for information on remittance types and the Cash Remittance System for details on remittance requirements for speciﬁc mortgage products.
For more information and to learn about additional terms and conditions associated with servicing-released executions, lenders should contact their Fannie Mae customer account team or the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk for details.
Other Best Eﬀorts Requirements
Fannie Mae's active document custodians serve as custodians for loans delivered via a best eﬀorts execution. For additional information on the role of document custodians, see C2-2-02, Documentation Requirements for Whole Loan Deliveries. Also, refer to Fannie Mae's Active Document Custodians for a complete list of eligible custodians.
Early funding is available for loans delivered in fulﬁllment of a best eﬀorts commitment. For details on this option and other options, and terms and conditions associated with best eﬀorts commitments, lenders should contact their Fannie Mae customer account team or the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk.
DU Recommendations on Loans Delivered with Best Eﬀorts Commitments
A lender may fulﬁll a best eﬀorts commitment by delivering a mortgage loan with a valid DU loan caseﬁle ID that is associated with the lender's institution ID. The DU loan caseﬁle must have received a DU recommendation of Approve/Eligible no earlier than 60 days prior to commitment. Alternatively, lenders may select the “Other” Underwriting Method (as viewed in the whole loan committing application), in which case a DU recommendation is not required.

Concurrent Sale of Servicing
Lenders may retain, release, or sell the servicing rights associated with the loans they deliver to Fannie Mae. Lenders may execute a concurrent transfer of servicing via Fannie Mae’s whole loan committing application with either a best eﬀorts or a mandatory commitment. By participating in the servicing-released component of the whole loan committing application, known as Servicing Marketplace, lenders may arrange for a concurrent sale of the servicing to an approved Fannie Mae servicer. See A3-3-02, Concurrent Servicing Transfers, for approval requirements and additional information.
All transfers of servicing using Servicing Marketplace must comply with this Guide and all applicable laws. The procedures and documentation required for a transfer of servicing are set out in the servicing transfer instructions available directly from the associated Servicing Marketplace transferee servicer.
A lender's rights and obligations related to a committed loan for which the lender has sold the servicing are as set forth in the Mortgage Selling and Servicing Contract and the Selling and Servicing Guides, and use of the whole loan committing application in no way alters a lender's obligations to Fannie Mae with respect to such

loans.
Relationship Between Lenders and Servicers
Lenders and servicers using Servicing Marketplace must execute a purchase and sale agreement that governs the sale of servicing rights between lenders and servicers as provided herein, or lenders and servicers will be subject to the terms and conditions of the mortgage loan purchase and sale agreement set forth in E-2-05, Servicing Marketplace — Mortgage Loan Servicing Purchase and Sale Agreement.
No Recourse to Fannie Mae
Servicers are encouraged to use the Servicing Marketplace rate sheet to establish the price they will pay a seller for servicing. Fannie Mae's calculation of the net SRP and the net funding SRP using the servicer’s rate sheet is based on unpaid principal balance, escrow funds, and other loan information submitted by the lender at loan delivery. Fannie Mae accepts no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of such information and is entitled to rely on such information in calculating the net SRP and, if the servicer uses the “All-In Funding” feature of Servicing Marketplace, in collecting an amount equal to the net funding SRP from the servicer and remitting it to the lender on behalf of the servicer (or in deducting an amount equal to any negative net funding SRP from the acquisition proceeds and remitting it to the active servicer). Lenders will have no recourse to Fannie Mae if issues arise with any of the following:
the accuracy or completeness of the information used to calculate the net SRP or the net funding SRP;
the accuracy and completeness of any information that the lender obtains from the whole loan committing application and uses or relies upon in any way;
the lender's sale (or attempted sale) of servicing to the servicer (other than the calculation, collection, and remittance of the net funding SRP and transfer of certain data to the servicer); or
the servicing obligations and obligations relating to escrow funds.
Number of Servicers in Servicing Marketplace

Chapter C2-2, Whole Loan Deliveries to and Purchasing by
Fannie Mae
Introduction
Whether selling whole loans to Fannie Mae under the terms of a mandatory, best eﬀorts or converted ARM resale commitment, lenders receive the sale proceeds when they have made “good delivery.” This means that the mortgages delivered meet all of Fannie Mae’s underwriting and legal criteria and satisfy the terms of the commitment under which they are being delivered. This chapter provides information on the lender’s requirements for making good delivery and the policies and procedures Fannie Mae uses to fund Fannie Mae’s purchases. See C1-2-02, Loan Data and Documentation Delivery Requirements, for general information about this subject.
C2-2-01, General Requirements for Good Delivery of Whole Loans
(08/07/2018)
Introduction This topic provides Fannie Mae’s requirements for good delivery of whole loans, including:
Deﬁnition of Whole Loan Good Delivery Amortization Schedule Requirements for Whole Loans Limitations on High-Balance Whole Loan Deliveries Whole Loan Good Delivery Amounts Overdeliveries of Whole Loan Commitments Extending and Pairing-Out of Whole Loan Commitments
Deﬁnition of Whole Loan Good Delivery
To receive funding for loans delivered in fulﬁllment of a mandatory, best eﬀorts, or converted ARM resale commitment, lenders must make “good delivery,” meaning the loans delivered must meet all of Fannie Mae’s underwriting and legal criteria and satisfy the terms of the original commitment.
Fannie Mae’s good delivery requirements are not met unless:
the applicable error-free mortgage documents and data reach the Fannie Mae-approved document custodian no later than the ﬁrst morning delivery, the day prior to the expiration date of the commitment;
Published February 5, 2025
948
the data reﬂected on the Loan Schedules pass all of the Fannie Mae purchasing edits;
the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all mortgages delivered under the commitment at least equals Fannie Mae’s minimum required delivery amount (but does not exceed the maximum delivery amount on the expiration day of the commitment); and
the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all mortgages delivered under the commitment does not exceed Fannie Mae's delivery limits for loans with nonstandard characteristics, such as high-balance loans.
To make good delivery on a best eﬀorts commitment, the information concerning the loan that is delivered must match the key data elements speciﬁed in Fannie Mae’s whole loan committing application.
Amortization Schedule Requirements for Whole Loans
For whole loans delivered to Fannie Mae, the ﬁrst payment date must be no later than two months from the ﬁnal disbursement date of the loan proceeds. In the case of a single-close construction-to-permanent loan, the two month period begins at the time of the conversion to permanent ﬁnancing.
The following table provides an example of this requirement.

Limitations on High-Balance Whole Loan Deliveries
The following outlines key whole loan requirements:
In the whole loan committing application, high-balance 10-, 15-, 20-, and 30-year fully amortizing ﬁxed- rate mortgage loans are eligible for delivery under standard whole loan mandatory commitments, as long as the high-balance loans do not comprise more than 10% of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the commitment. If the delivery of a high-balance mortgage loan causes the lender to exceed the 10% limitation, the lender is required to deliver the mortgage loan against a high-balance whole loan commitment. High-balance products are available in the whole loan committing application for this purpose.
Note: 10–year fully amortizing ﬁxed-rate high-balance mortgage loans are delivered under a 15–year high-balance commitment and 20–year fully amortizing ﬁxed-rate high-balance mortgage loans are delivered under a 30–year high-balance commitment.
Published February 5, 2025
949
The 10% limitation does not apply in the whole loan committing application to high-balance mortgage loans originated with non-TBA-eligible products (for example, ARMs) which may be delivered against standard conforming whole loan commitments, with no restriction on concentration.
For best eﬀorts commitments in the whole loan committing application, 15–year and 30–year fully amortizing ﬁxed-rate high-balance mortgage loans must be delivered under 15–year or 30–year high- balance commitments, respectively. High-balance mortgage loans with 10– or 20–year ﬁxed-rate terms or non-TBA-eligible products (such as ARMs) are not accommodated for best eﬀorts commitments.
See B5-1-01, High-Balance Mortgage Loan Eligibility and Underwriting and B5-1-02, High-Balance Pricing, Mortgage Insurance, Special Feature Codes, and Delivery Limitations for additional information about high- balance mortgage loans.
Whole Loan Good Delivery Amounts
To make good delivery on a mandatory commitment, lenders must deliver loans for which the total UPB does not fall below the greater of $10,000 or 2.5% of the original commitment amount.
The minimum required delivery amount is an amount that will not fall below the original commitment amount by more than the greater of $10,000 or 2.5% of the original commitment amount, unless a lender requests a partial pair-oﬀ of a commitment. If that occurs, the minimum required delivery amount will be reduced to $50 below the revised commitment amount.
The maximum delivery amount is an amount that will not exceed the original commitment amount by more than the greater of $10,000 or 2.5% of the original commitment amount, unless a lender requests an overdelivery. If a lender requests an overdelivery, the maximum required delivery amount will be $50 above the revised commitment amount.
Overdeliveries of Whole Loan Commitments
Lenders may request permission via the whole loan committing application for mandatory commitments or by contacting the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk (see E-1-02, List of Contacts) during regular business hours to over deliver, or deliver a total UPB that exceeds the maximum delivery amount.
The maximum overdelivery amount is 25% of the original commitment amount. For example, on an original commitment amount of $150,000, the maximum overdelivery amount is an additional $37,500 (25% of $150,000). In this example, the total delivered against the commitment cannot exceed $187,550 ($150,000 + $37,500 + $50).
After an overdelivery occurs, the maximum delivery tolerance level decreases to $50 above the new commitment amount. For commitments for which the overdelivery calculation (based on 25% of the original commitment amount) is less than $10,000, the high tolerance level becomes the maximum amount the lender can deliver.
Fannie Mae generally bases its decision on whether an overdelivery price adjustment will be due based on the movement in market prices between the date the commitment was originally obtained and the date on which Fannie Mae approved the overdelivery. If a price adjustment is due, Fannie Mae will draft an overdelivery price adjustment from the lender’s designated account on the following business day.

Required Documents for Whole Loans Submission of Documents for Whole Loans to a Document Custodian Whole Loan Deliveries to a Document Custodian
Required Documents for Whole Loans
See E-2-01, Required Custodial Documents, for a list of the mortgage documents that must be included in the document submission package for all loans.
Submission of Documents for Whole Loans to a Document Custodian
Mortgage document submission packages must be submitted to the document custodian via overnight delivery (with instructions for ﬁrst morning delivery) for the following:
whole loans,
As Soon As Pooled Plus (ASAP Plus), and
As Soon As Pooled (ASAP Sale).
All packages should be sent to the assigned document custodian and addressed according to the instructions provided by that custodian. The document custodian will certify the loans in accordance with the Master Custodial Agreement (Form 2017) in eﬀect for Fannie Mae, the lender, and itself.
Whole Loan Deliveries to a Document Custodian
Published February 5, 2025
951
Lenders are required to submit data for whole loan deliveries to Fannie Mae via Fannie Mae’s Loan Delivery application.
To ensure timely delivery to the document custodian, the seller should ensure the loan document submission package is submitted to its overnight carrier (with instructions for ﬁrst morning delivery) the same day that the seller submits the loan data to Fannie Mae for purchase. Loan data delivered by the seller to Fannie Mae will be certiﬁed the next business day provided the documents have been delivered to the document custodian via ﬁrst morning delivery, and there are no discrepancies and no unresolved lien issues.
When the document custodian receives the mortgage document submission package, it will review the related loan documentation to verify that all of the required documents have been received and are in order. The document custodian will then work with the lender to correct any certiﬁcation data or document errors. Lenders can opt-in to receive email notices through Loan Delivery when data or document discrepancies are noted during certiﬁcation. Lenders then have the option to accept or decline data changes the custodian proposes as a result of the discrepancy on the note and the data they provided. The lender must work with the custodian to ensure all discrepancies are resolved.
If there are no document or data-related errors, the document custodian will transmit a certiﬁcation to Fannie Mae.

C2-2-03, General Information on Whole Loan Purchasing Policies
(05/04/2022)
Introduction This topic includes information on the conditions under which Fannie Mae will fund the purchase of a loan delivered in fulﬁllment of a whole loan commitment, including:
Whole Loan Funding Requirements Warehouse Lender’s Release of Interest in the Property Procedures Related to the Secure Transfer of Funds
Whole Loan Funding Requirements
Published February 5, 2025
952
Fannie Mae will send the proceeds from the whole loan sale via a wire transfer into the lender’s designated account on the "Purchased and Funded" date (as reﬂected in Loan Delivery) if:
the designated payee code is valid;
the loan is eligible for purchase; and
the document custodian received a complete, accurate mortgage document submission package and loan delivery data by the applicable cutoﬀ times.
Fannie Mae will direct the wire transfer to either:
the account(s) and depository institution(s) the lender designates, or
the lender itself (if it is able to receive wire transfers through the Fedwire system).
To avoid delays in purchasing and funding, Fannie Mae accepts delivery of any mortgage up to 45 days from the due date of the reported last paid installment.
Warehouse Lender’s Release of Interest in the Property
When Fannie Mae purchases a mortgage, the mortgage seller represents and warrants that title to the mortgage note is free and clear of any security interest, lien, pledge, or other encumbrance, which means that any interest held by a warehouse lender must be released no later than the date Fannie Mae acquires the note.
To ensure that this is always the case, Fannie Mae has established delivery procedures to cover those instances in which the document custodian either:
receives with the mortgage delivery documents a bailee letter notifying it of a warehouse lender’s security interest, or
is otherwise aware that a warehouse lender is claiming an interest of any kind in the mortgage notes being delivered.
This process is intended solely to ensure the correctness of the selling representations and warranties a mortgage seller makes to Fannie Mae (and not to beneﬁt any third party). These procedures are outlined in C1-2-06, Bailee Letters. Also see C1-2-03, Ownership of Mortgage Loans Prior to Purchase or Securitization and Third-Party Security Interests, for additional information.
Fannie Mae also has established operational procedures that can be used to reduce instances of conﬂicting delivery instructions for pledged mortgages. See C1-1-01, Execution Options.
Procedures Related to the Secure Transfer of Funds
Each lender is responsible for establishing and maintaining controls and procedures that ensure the conﬁdentiality of all transfer instructions and payee codes and the integrity of its communications with Fannie Mae.
The lender agrees to be bound by any transfer instructions issued in its name and sent to Fannie Mae, whether or not they were authorized.
Published February 5, 2025
953
A lender is solely liable for transfers that are initiated (either directly or indirectly) as the result of a breach in its security arrangements or as the result of its failure to give Fannie Mae timely notice of an error, omission, or irregularity in establishing payee arrangements. The lender is fully responsible for notifying the Fannie Mae Asset Acquisitions by telephone and submitting written conﬁrmation of the call to Fannie Mae within 24 hours of the breach. Fannie Mae will do everything possible to suspend operations until a correction is sent, including removing all payee codes on record for the lender and issuing new codes based on instructions the lender provides in accordance with Fannie Mae standard procedures.
The lender is advised that these procedures will not be used to detect an error in the transmission or content of a transfer of funds to the lender’s designated bank or an error in processing a request to set up a payee code for use in transferring funds.

C2-2-04, Timing of Distribution of Whole Loan Purchase Proceeds
(05/04/2022)
Introduction This topic describes the timing of Fannie Mae’s funding of loans it purchases, including:
Timing of Distribution of Proceeds for Regularly Amortizing Mortgages Impact of Late Submissions of Required Data and Documentation Early Funding Options
Timing of Distribution of Proceeds for Regularly Amortizing Mortgages
Fannie Mae will fund the purchase proceeds for whole loan deliveries of regularly amortizing mortgages provided the following procedure has already occurred:
lender has electronically submitted clean, error-free loan delivery data through Loan Delivery by 9:00 p.m. (Eastern time),
Published February 5, 2025
954
the document custodian has received a complete and accurate mortgage document submission package from a lender by ﬁrst morning delivery the following day, and
the document custodian has certiﬁed the mortgage document submission package.
Following the funding of the purchase proceeds the loan status in Loan Delivery will be "Purchased and Funded."
Impact of Late Submissions of Required Data and Documentation
If the required delivery data and documentation are not received by the applicable cutoﬀ time, Fannie Mae will disburse the purchase proceeds on the business day following the date it receives these materials, assuming they are in order and the mortgage is eligible for purchase.
Early Funding Options
Fannie Mae oﬀers approved lenders the ability to receive funding at earlier points in the process. For information on Fannie Mae’s Early Funding Options and Loan Delivery, the application lenders use to submit requests for early funding, see Fannie Mae’s website or contact the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk (see E-1-02, List of Contacts).

C2-2-05, Whole Loan Purchasing Process (10/04/2023)
Introduction This topic provides information on the process Fannie Mae uses to notify the lender (and the servicer, if the lender is not servicing the loan) of a whole loan purchase, including:
Notiﬁcation to Lender of Purchases of Regularly Amortizing Mortgages Contents of the Purchase Advice Reconciliation of Purchase Advices and After Sale Corrections to Whole Loan Disbursements Submission of Mortgage Record Change to HUD for FHA Mortgage Purchases
Published February 5, 2025
955
Notiﬁcation to Lender of Purchases of Regularly Amortizing Mortgages
Lenders can access the following documents in Fannie Mae Connect:
a seller’s Purchase Advice to detail Fannie Mae’s disbursement of the purchase proceeds, and
a report to summarize the lender’s purchases for each whole loan commitment.
Servicers can obtain a Purchase Advice to provide the information necessary for its accounting records for the mortgages that it is servicing on behalf of a lender.
Contents of the Purchase Advice
The Purchase Advice will contain the following information:
each loan, identiﬁed by a Fannie Mae loan number (which the servicer should enter into its records immediately because it must be used in reporting all subsequent activity related to the mortgage to Fannie Mae);
details about the loan purchase, including loan information, price adjustments, and purchase proceeds; and
a report with the applicable payee code for each wire transfer request.
The Purchase Advice will be available on the business day Fannie Mae funds the purchase proceeds.
Reconciliation of Purchase Advices and After Sale Corrections to Whole Loan Disbursements
The lender should examine each Purchase Advice it receives and reconcile the advice to its books and records to ensure that any transfer of funds is properly credited to the lender’s designated bank.
Fannie Mae expects lenders to have appropriate controls and procedures in place to perform timely and accurate reconciliations of the transfers of funds for all whole loan deliveries.
The lender must submit a post-purchase adjustment request to provide notice of any error, omission, or irregularity in the transfer of funds or in processing the request for the repetitive transfer within 30 days of the date of the Purchase Advice. Otherwise, Fannie Mae will assume that the information on its Purchase Advice is correct.
If the lender believes the amount disbursed is incorrect, it can request an adjustment by following the instructions provided in Seller/Servicer-Initiated Post-Purchase Adjustments.
The request must include the following:
the lender’s nine-digit Fannie Mae seller/servicer number,
Published February 5, 2025
956
the ten-digit Fannie Mae loan number,
the Post-Purchase Adjustment Request form, and
applicable documentation.
See Seller/Servicer-Initiated Post-Purchase Adjustments in C1-2-02, Loan Data and Documentation Delivery Requirements for additional information.
Submission of Mortgage Record Change to HUD for FHA Mortgage Purchases
After the lender receives notiﬁcation that Fannie Mae has purchased a regularly amortizing FHA loan for its portfolio, the lender must complete a Mortgage Record Change (HUD Form 92080) and submit it to HUD through FHA Connection.
For notiﬁcations to FHA, lenders will also need to include Fannie Mae’s Mortgagee Number 950010999 on the form. Only the ﬁrst ﬁve digits of this number are required if submitting the HUD form through FHA Connection.
Note: Fannie Mae is not currently purchasing FHA loans.

designated accounts, including:
Documentation Requirements Lender’s Agreement Related to the Execution of the Authorization to Transfer Funds Authorization for Repetitive Transfers Changes to or Deletion of the Authority to Transfer Funds
Documentation Requirements
Fannie Mae will not transfer purchase proceeds for whole loan deliveries to a lender’s designated bank account until the lender has provided Fannie Mae with an executed Certiﬁcate of Authority, Incumbency, and Specimen Signatures ( Form 360) that designates the person or persons authorized to establish, change, or delete wire transfer instructions on the lender’s behalf.
Lender’s Agreement Related to the Execution of the Authorization to Transfer Funds
By executing Form 360, a lender agrees that
Fannie Mae is authorized to conclusively rely on the accuracy, genuineness, and good faith of any written communication related to transfer instructions that bears the signature of one of the individuals designated on Form 360; and
it will be fully responsible for any and all losses incurred by Fannie Mae that result from Fannie Mae’s reliance on any instruction given to Fannie Mae by the lender’s authorized representatives or any other person who has (or obtains) access to information or documents that compromise the security of any Fannie Mae electronic fund transfer systems or processes.
After Fannie Mae receives an executed Form 360 from a lender, Fannie Mae will rely on the information on that Certiﬁcation until such time as the lender requests to modify or delete it.
Authorization for Repetitive Transfers
A repetitive transfer is one in which all aspects of the transfer, other than the date of the transfer and the amount of funds transferred, remain constant over time.
A lender that wants the purchase proceeds for the whole loan deliveries that it submits over any period of time to be wired to the same account(s) and depository institution(s) must have its authorized representative(s) submit a separate Seller’s Designation of Wire Transfer Instructions ( Form 482) for each arrangement, specifying any desired transfer routing instructions, any intermediary depository institutions, and appropriate account numbers for these repetitive transfers. Fannie Mae will
call the authorized representative who signed the Form 482 request to conﬁrm validity prior to processing. assign a unique payee code to identify each of the lender’s instructions for repetitive transfers. The lender must then use this payee code to identify each whole loan delivery for which the purchase

958
proceeds are to be wired to the designated payee. rely on the ABA routing number and the account numbers that the lender’s representative speciﬁes on the Form 482 when it creates a payee code to identify each individual payee arrangement. Fannie Mae will make no eﬀort to verify the accuracy of the routing number or the account numbers.
Changes to or Deletion of the Authority to Transfer Funds
To add, delete, or change an authorized representative, the lender must submit a new Form 360 and corporate resolution.
Fannie Mae reserves the right to verify or authenticate any request for a change, but the lender cannot consider Fannie Mae’s failure to do so an act of negligence.
In emergency situations, Fannie Mae may, in its sole discretion, delete the name of an authorized representative on the basis of a telephone call and/or an email request from another authorized representative; however, a revised Form 360 and a new corporate resolution must then be submitted promptly as conﬁrmation of the change.
Fannie Mae will make reasonable eﬀorts to act quickly on requests for emergency deletions of the names of authorized representatives. Fannie Mae cannot guarantee that it will be able to act quickly enough to prevent the execution of transfers by the individuals being deleted and bears no liability for the execution of any such transfers.

MBS Program Description UMBS Program Description MBS Single-Family Pool Trust Agreement Guaranty Fees MBS Pricing Parameters MBS Servicing Fees MBS Remittance Types and Cycles MBS Program Transaction Options Structured Transactions Fannie Mae’s Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk
MBS Program Description
Fannie Mae MBS are securities that represent an ownership interest in pools of residential mortgages with similar characteristics. MBS are also known as “pass-through certiﬁcates,” because the principal and interest on the underlying mortgages are passed through to investors based on the percentage of the security that each investor owns. Fannie Mae guarantees to the related trust holding the mortgages that it will supplement amounts received by that trust as required to permit timely payment of principal and interest on the MBS.
Fannie Mae’s MBS program provides for the issuance and sale of MBS that represent fractional, undivided, beneﬁcial ownership interests in a distinct pool of mortgages, such as the following mortgage types:
conventional,
FHA-insured,
VA-guaranteed, and
HUD-guaranteed Section 184 loans.
MBS transactions result in the formation of one of two types of pools:
a single-lender pool, in which all of the mortgages share a common characteristic, such as amortization type, loan term or range of loan terms, mortgage type, or ARM plan number. The minimum pool size (aggregate UPB) for a ﬁxed rate, single-lender pool is $1 million. For ARMs, the minimum pool size is $500,000.
a multiple-lender pool, known as a Fannie Majors, that consists of pools of whole mortgages delivered by more than one lender. For Fannie Mae to open a Fannie Majors pool, the pool’s aggregate UPB must meet the minimum amounts noted above. Once opened, a lender may deliver loans with UPBs as low as $1,000.
Published February 5, 2025
962
UMBS Program Description
A common security issued by the GSEs that is eligible for trading in the To-be-Announced market. The securities are backed by ﬁxed-rate loans secured by single-family one-to-four unit properties and are identiﬁed by certain pool preﬁxes.
MBS Single-Family Pool Trust Agreement
Fannie Mae holds, in its capacity as trustee, the mortgages sold to Fannie Mae by a lender or lenders in a trust comprising the pool and issues MBS that are backed by those mortgages. All mortgage loans related to a pool represent a separate trust and issuance of MBS. For each issuance of MBS, there will be an issue supplement to the Trust Agreement.
The Trust Agreement and any issue supplement are entered into by Fannie Mae in its corporate capacity (as Issuer, Master Servicer and Guarantor) and as Trustee. The trust agreement is posted at Single Family Master Trust Agreement. Issue supplements are available to investors in related pools upon request from the Fixed- Income Investor Helpline; see E-1-02, List of Contacts.
The Amended and Restated 2016 Single-Family Master Trust Agreement is eﬀective for all ﬁxed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in pools delivered to Fannie Mae, and Pooled from Portfolio loans included in pools, for all MBS issued on or after June 1, 2016.
Guaranty Fees
The lender must pay Fannie Mae a guaranty fee remittance each month as compensation for the lender’s right to participate in the MBS program. The guaranty fee is ultimately a corporate responsibility of the servicer and is not a function of the pool cash ﬂows; therefore, it must be paid even if there is no pool collection activity.
The guaranty fee remittance rate for MBS mortgages varies depending on:
the credit risk of mortgages included in the pool,
the servicing option that applies to each mortgage in the pool, and
the remittance cycle that applies to the pool.
For additional details, see C1-1-01, Execution Options.
Lenders may buy up or buy down their guaranty fees. See C3-2-03, MBS Remittance Type and Selecting a Remittance Cycle, and Chapter C3–3, MBS Guaranty Fees and Guaranty Fee Buyups and Buydowns, for more information.
MBS Pricing Parameters
MBS prices are driven by investors and can change continually throughout the day. Pricing is a function of the security itself, such as, the type of mortgage backing the security and the coupon rate (the rate at which
Published February 5, 2025
963
interest is paid to the investor); and market factors, such as interest rate ﬂuctuations and overall MBS demand.
MBS may be bought or sold at par, at a premium, or at a discount, that is, a price equal to, greater than, or less than 100% of their face value.
MBS Servicing Fees
The lender determines the amount of the total servicing compensation it wants to receive when it establishes the interest rate for the mortgage, but Fannie Mae requires that it provide for at least a minimum servicing fee. Generally, the total servicing fee for a regularly amortizing mortgage is the diﬀerence between the interest rate of a loan and the sum of (a) the pass-through rate on the loan (or, for ARMs, the loan’s contributions to the pool accrual rate) and (b) the guaranty fee.
The total servicing fee that is established when the MBS pool is formed generally will remain in eﬀect for the life of the pool (without regard to whether the pool contains ﬁxed-rate loans or ARMs).
For all ﬁxed-rate loans, the minimum servicing fee is 25 basis points (.25%) and the maximum servicing fee is limited to 50 basis points (.50%).
For ARM loans, the minimum servicing fee is 25 basis points (.25%).
For additional information regarding minimum and maximum servicing fees, refer to Servicing Guide F-2-08, Servicing Fees for MBS Mortgage Loans.
MBS Remittance Types and Cycles
The scheduled principal and interest due on mortgages pooled into MBS must be remitted to Fannie Mae, whether or not it is collected from the borrowers (that is, accounted for using the scheduled/scheduled remittance type).
MBS Program Transaction Options
Lenders can opt to either hold the MBS in their investment portfolio (often referred to as a “swap-and-hold” transaction) or sell the MBS to another investor as part of the same transaction (“swap-and-sell”). Lenders can choose to service the mortgages underlying the MBS or sell the servicing associated with these loans to another ﬁnancial institution.
Structured Transactions
MBS may be combined with other Fannie Mae mortgage-related securities to create a single structured transaction security, such as:
Supers - Pass-through securities backed by groups of existing UMBS or other existing Supers;
Megas — Pass-through securities backed by groups of existing MBS or other existing Megas;
Published February 5, 2025
964
SMBS — Pass-through securities created by either (1) restructuring the interest and principal payments into separately tradable securities (standard SMBS) or (2) with Fannie Mae’s approval, depositing into an SMBS trust a portion of the interest payable on mortgage loans backing certain MBS—the “excess yield” (excess servicing SMBS); and
REMICs — Multiclass mortgage-related securities backed by UMBS, MBS, Supers, Megas or whole loans.
Lenders that wish to deliver mortgage-related securities to Fannie Mae in exchange for a structured transaction security should contact the Capital Markets Structured Transactions group, to seek approval to do so.
Fannie Mae’s Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk
Lenders in good standing may be eligible to use the services of Fannie Mae’s Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk (“the Desk”) to either buy or sell MBS (and whole loans as well). The Desk also assists lenders in obtaining current market quotes and in ﬁnding markets for nonstandard MBS products. However, the Desk will not make individualized trade recommendations or determine the appropriateness or beneﬁt of any particular transaction or strategy for a lender.
Lenders should note that they must consent to the recordation of all telephone conversations with the Desk. In the event of a conﬂict between a recorded telephone conversation and a conﬁrmation or settlement notice sent by Fannie Mae to the lender, the recorded conversation represents the oﬃcial terms of the transaction.

C3-1-02, Preparing to Pool Loans into MBS (05/01/2019)
Introduction This topic provides information on the steps lenders need to take before they can obtain MBS commitments and pool loans into MBS, including:
Obtaining Approval to Deliver MBS Loans Selecting a Document Custodian
Published February 5, 2025
965
Obtaining Approval to Deliver MBS Loans
A lender must obtain approval for MBS execution and access to Fannie Mae’s MBS committing application before it can deliver mortgages into a single-lender MBS pool or a Fannie Majors.
Fannie Mae considers a number of factors prior to oﬀering MBS execution to a lender. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
the expertise of the lender’s management in securitization,
whether the lender’s operational processes support MBS delivery and servicing requirements,
the lender’s ability to manage and maintain a delivery process that ensures the delivery of accurate data to Fannie Mae,
the lender’s prepayment speeds, and
the lender’s performance against outstanding Fannie Mae obligations.
Fannie Mae does not accept requests for MBS execution from lenders whose selling or servicing privileges have been suspended or that have not performed satisfactorily under other MBS commitments or contracts.
Selecting a Document Custodian
Lenders must select an eligible document custodian and have an executed Master Custodial Agreement (Form 2017) in place before obtaining an MBS commitment (see A3-3-04, Document Custodians). The document custodian certiﬁes, takes and retains actual physical possession of the custodial documents for the mortgages. Also, see the RDC guide for document custodian eligibility criteria, and Fannie Mae's Active Document Custodians for a complete list of eligible custodians.

C3-2-01, Determining Eligibility for Loans Pooled into MBS
(09/07/2022)
Introduction This topic contains information on eligibility requirements for loans pooled into MBS (which includes UMBS), including:
General Eligibility Requirements for Loans Pooled into MBS Nonstandard Loans Identifying Nonstandard Loans at Delivery Amortization Schedule Requirements for MBS Loans Requirements for Pooling Seasoned Loans into MBS Interest Rate Requirements for Loans Pooled into MBS Servicer Requirements for Loans Pooled into MBS
General Eligibility Requirements for Loans Pooled into MBS
All loans pooled into MBS must be secured by a ﬁrst mortgage and must represent the entire right, title, and interest in the note and the related security instrument, unless the MBS commitment expressly indicates otherwise.
As of the issue date of the MBS, the loans in the related MBS pool may not be delinquent by more than one monthly installment of principal and interest that is due on the issue date (including the period beginning on the second day of the month preceding the issue date and ending on the issue date). For example, if the ﬁrst payment date is November 1, and the issue date of the MBS is January 1, then, in order to be eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae, the November and December payments must have been paid, and the only payment that may be delinquent (due) would be for the period December 2 through January 1.
In addition,
if the loan is one year or less from the ﬁrst payment date to the pool issue date, the borrower cannot have any 30–day delinquencies since origination; and
if the current borrower assumed the loan and has owned the property for one year or less, the borrower must have no 30-day delinquencies since purchasing the property.
See B2-1.5-02, Loan Eligibility, for the requirements concerning seasoned loans.
Nonstandard Loans
“Nonstandard loans” (or loans with nonstandard characteristics) may be pooled into MBS, but depending on the concentration in the pool, may only be pooled as negotiated rather than standard transactions.
Nonstandard loans are:
Published February 5, 2025
967
co-op share loans,
relocation loans (deﬁned below),
loans with signiﬁcant interest rate buydowns, and
high-balance loans.
In a TBA-eligible UMBS pool, nonstandard loans are each limited to 10% of the issue date UPB of a TBA-eligible UMBS pool. If loans with more than one of the nonstandard characteristics are included in the same TBA-eligible UMBS pool, the sum of the issue date UPB of two or more of the loans with nonstandard characteristics may not exceed 15% of the total issue date UPB of the pool. The 15% cumulative limitation, however, does not apply to high-balance loans.
For pools with greater than 10% concentrations of nonstandard loans, see the Pool Preﬁx Glossary for the applicable pool preﬁxes. Nonstandard loans may be delivered into existing MBS commitments and may use the same base guaranty fee as those used for the lender’s standard conforming loans.
Lenders may deliver loans with the nonstandard characteristics described above into Fannie Majors TBA-eligible UMBS pools. For Fannie Majors requirements, see C3-6-01, Parameters for Pooling Loans Into Fannie Majors.
For the purposes of TBA pooling parameters, a relocation loan is an owner-occupied purchase money loan, originated pursuant to an established employee relocation program, administered by the employer (or its agent), where the employer relocates employees as part of its normal course of business. A loan that involves an employee relocation that does not meet these parameters is not considered a relocation loan for TBA pooling purposes, and as such, the pooling limitations and SFC 013 delivery requirement are not applicable.
Examples
The issue date UPB of loans with signiﬁcant interest rate buydowns and the issue date UPB of co-op share loans individually may not exceed 10% of the total issue date UPB of the TBA-eligible UMBS, and together may not exceed 15% of the total TBA-eligible UMBS. However, while the issue date UPB of high-balance loans and the issue date UPB of co-op share loans individually may not exceed 10% of the total issue date UPB of the TBA- eligible UMBS, together they may exceed 15% of the total TBA-eligible UMBS because high-balance loans are not subject to the 15% limitation.
Identifying Nonstandard Loans at Delivery
As a reminder, nonstandard loans must be identiﬁed at delivery with the following:
relocation loans – SFC 013
loans with signiﬁcant interest rate buydowns – SFC 014
high-balance loans – SFC 808
co-op share loans – the Legal Structure in Loan Delivery is “cooperative.”
Amortization Schedule Requirements for MBS Loans
For loans pooled into MBS, the ﬁrst payment date must be no later than two months from the ﬁnal disbursement
Published February 5, 2025
968
date of the loan proceeds. In the case of a single-close construction-to-permanent loan, the two-month period begins at the time of the conversion to permanent ﬁnancing.
The following table provides an example of this requirement.
If the ﬁnal disbursement date occurs in...
Then the ﬁrst payment date must be no later than...
January
March
February
April
November
January
Standard pooling allows lenders to include in an MBS pool only those loans for which the ﬁrst payment date is no later than the ﬁrst day of the month that immediately follows the issue date of the related MBS. The pool issue date is the ﬁrst day of the month in which securities backed by the MBS pool are issued. For seasoned loans, the ﬁrst payment date must be at least 12 months prior to the pool’s issue date.
In addition, the loan’s amortization schedule must not provide for any period during which principal has been disbursed and is outstanding, but interest is not accruing. However, if the lender chooses to pool within the same month of loan origination (also known as "same month pooling"), the loan may begin to amortize on the ﬁrst day of the month that is two months after the issue date of the securities, with the initial remittance to Fannie Mae being an “interest-only” remittance, because the borrower will not have made their ﬁrst payment at the time of the initial remittance.
A negotiated contract is needed to pool loans for which the borrower’s monthly payment is due on a day other than ﬁrst of the month (“odd due dates”).
Requirements for Pooling Seasoned Loans into MBS
Lenders may pool current or seasoned loans into a single-lender MBS. Fannie Mae has no minimum seasoning requirement for conventional loans included in single pool transactions. Refer to C3-6-01, Parameters for Pooling Loans Into Fannie Majors for additional information about seasoning for Fannie Majors.
If a pool of ARM loans will have amortized by more than 12 monthly payments as of the issue date of the pool, the terms of a negotiated contract will specify whether the loans will be treated as current or seasoned. The key determinants are the length of the interest rate adjustment intervals and whether interest rate or payment adjustments will have occurred by the pool’s issue date.
For a converted ARM (which is a ﬁxed-rate loan that was once an ARM until the borrower exercised an option to convert it to a ﬁxed rate), the 12-month period is measured from the date of conversion to the issue date month of the related pool.
To sell seasoned loans under an MBS execution, lenders must have an MBS commitment that permits delivery of seasoned loans. For information on pricing and parameters, contact the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk (see E-1-02, List of Contacts).
Published February 5, 2025

Interest Rate Requirements for Loans Pooled into MBS
Loans with diﬀerent annual rates of interest can be included in the same MBS pool, as long as those rates fall within the minimum and maximum spreads Fannie Mae allows between the loan interest rates and the pass- through rate for the MBS pool.
For ﬁxed-rate loans that are pooled, the minimum allowable interest rate is 25 basis points (.25%) above the pool’s pass-through rate and the maximum allowable interest rate is 112.5 basis points (1.125%) above the pool’s pass-through rate.
Generally, for ARMs that are pooled, the minimum allowable interest rate is the sum of the lowest guaranty fee (after all applicable adjustments have been made, including buyups and buydowns) and the lender’s minimum servicing fee, which must include renewal premiums for lender-purchased mortgage insurance, if applicable. The recommended maximum allowable interest rate is 100 basis points (1%) over the minimum allowable interest rate. Lenders must comply with the allowable minimum and maximum interest rates for each MBS ARM structure.
Servicer Requirements for Loans Pooled into MBS
All loans in a single issuer MBS pool must be serviced by the same entity. If a lender plans to deliver several pieces for inclusion in a multiple pool (Fannie Majors), each piece may have a diﬀerent servicer. The lender may deliver any combination of seller/servicer numbers for inclusion in a multiple pool (Fannie Majors), however the servicers designated must be servicing loans in the multiple pool that have the same remittance cycle as the loans being delivered.

C3-2-02, Selecting a Servicing Option (04/01/2009)
Introduction This topic provides information about the two options lenders must choose from when deciding how they wish to service loans pooled into MBS. These options include:
Impact of Servicing Option Selection on Guaranty Fees Regular Servicing Option Special Servicing Option
Impact of Servicing Option Selection on Guaranty Fees
Guaranty fees are aﬀected by the servicing option chosen by the lender. Generally, the guaranty fee for pooled loans serviced under the Regular Servicing option is typically lower than for pooled loans serviced under the Special Servicing option.
Regular Servicing Option
Under the Regular Servicing option (identiﬁed by foreclosure risk code L), the lender assumes the entire risk of loss from a borrower default while servicing the mortgage and, as a result, is charged a lower guaranty fee. The lender also agrees to provide for a successor to this agreement if it transfers its responsibilities for servicing the mortgage to another servicer.
Special Servicing Option
Under the Special Servicing option (identiﬁed by foreclosure risk code F), Fannie Mae assumes the risk of loss from a borrower default. Fannie Mae reimburses the lender for its share of the lender’s unrecovered advances for delinquencies and advances related to servicing the mortgages.
See the Servicing Guide for more information about both options.

C3-2-03, MBS Remittance Type and Selecting a Remittance Cycle
Published February 5, 2025
971
(10/25/2011)
Introduction In this topic, the lender’s options with respect to remitting principal and interest on MBS pool loans are addressed, including:
MBS Pool Remittance Type Standard Remittance Cycle
MBS Pool Remittance Type
All MBS mortgages are accounted for as the scheduled/scheduled remittance type. This means that a servicer may have to advance its own funds to cover the amount Fannie Mae is due on a mortgage for which the monthly payment of principal and interest is late.
Standard Remittance Cycle
Under the standard remittance cycle, lenders remit scheduled P&I payments on the 18th of the month in which they are due from the borrowers (or, if the 18th is not a business day, on the business day preceding the 18th). Unscheduled principal payments must be remitted by the 18th of the month following collection.

C3-2-04, Mandatory MBS Commitments (12/06/2016)
Introduction This topic contains information on obtaining and fulﬁlling mandatory commitments to sell loans under an MBS execution, including:
Overview Mandatory MBS Committing Process Access to Guaranty Fee Pricing Negotiated Commitments MBS Commitment Rolls and Pair-Oﬀs
Overview
Published February 5, 2025
972
A lender must obtain an MBS commitment before it can deliver mortgages into a single lender MBS pool or a Fannie Majors. The commitment evidences an agreement between Fannie Mae and a lender to buy and sell, respectively, mortgages for inclusion in a particular MBS pool. These contracts set forth the terms and conditions for delivery of speciﬁed mortgages for MBS. When a lender enters into a mandatory MBS commitment to sell loans to Fannie Mae, the lender agrees to sell a certain volume of loans having a speciﬁed set of loan parameters to Fannie Mae, and Fannie Mae provides the lender with guaranty fee pricing for such mortgage loans for delivery under MBS execution.
Mandatory MBS Committing Process
To deliver MBS loans to Fannie Mae a lender must obtain a mandatory MBS commitment using Fannie Mae’s MBS committing application, a free Web-based application available to subscribers approved for MBS execution. The lender’s agreement to use Pricing & Execution (PE)-MBS in accordance with the applicable requirements is part of the Lender Contract. For more information and terms of use applicable to the PE-MBS application, see Fannie Mae’s website.
Lenders can obtain commitments on any weekday, with the exception of bond market observed holidays as deﬁned by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA). Lenders can also obtain commitments for delivery in a future MBS issue month for all mortgage products for which pricing is oﬀered through the MBS committing application.
Fannie Mae conﬁrmed its acceptance of the lender’s request for a mandatory commitment by electronically transmitting a commitment conﬁrmation to the lender. Lenders should contact the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk if they experience any problems receiving a commitment conﬁrmation (see E-1-02, List of Contacts).
Access to Guaranty Fee Pricing
Lenders obtain current guaranty fee pricing speciﬁc to their institution by accessing Fannie Mae’s MBS committing application. If the lender wants to request pricing for a mortgage product in an issue month that is not available in the MBS committing application, then the lender must contact its Fannie Mae customer account team or the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk.
Negotiated Commitments
Lenders that want to sell loans to Fannie Mae that contain unique eligibility and underwriting considerations not permissible for delivery via a standard commitment may request a negotiated commitment. Lenders should contact their Fannie Mae customer account team for details.
MBS Commitment Rolls and Pair-Oﬀs
MBS commitments are for mandatory delivery by the lender. If the lender is unable to meet the terms of the commitment, the lender must take the action in the MBS committing application to pair-oﬀ or roll the outstanding balance of the commitment before the last business day of the issue month applicable to that commitment. Fannie Mae may charge lenders for lender-executed or lender-requested rolls or pair-oﬀs for mandatory commitments. These fees, if charged, are drafted from the lender’s designated account.
Published February 5, 2025
973
Fannie Mae may pair-oﬀ the outstanding balance of a commitment on a lender’s behalf if the lender fails to pair- oﬀ or roll the outstanding balance into the following issue month by last business day of the issue month of the related commitment.

Chapter C3-3, MBS Guaranty Fees and Guaranty Fee Buyups
and Buydowns
Introduction
Lenders must pay Fannie Mae a guaranty fee remittance each month as compensation for the lender’s right to participate in the MBS program. This chapter provides information on guaranty fees and the requirements associated with buying the fee up or down.
C3-3-01, Determining and Remitting Guaranty Fees (10/25/2011)
Introduction This topic provides information on the factors used to determine the amount of a lender’s guaranty fee, including:
Guaranty Fee Overview Determining the Annualized Weighted-Average Guaranty Fee Factor for a Pool Determining the Monthly Guaranty Fee Remittance for the Pool Remitting Guaranty Fees to Fannie Mae
Guaranty Fee Overview
The guaranty fee for individual loans included in an MBS pool depends upon the credit risk associated with the loan and the lender’s choice of servicing option and remittance cycle. The guaranty fee remittance for MBS pools is based upon a weighted-average guaranty factor. See below for a description of how to calculate the annualized weighted-guaranty factor and the pool guaranty fee.
Determining the Annualized Weighted-Average Guaranty Fee Factor for a Pool
The annualized weighted-average guaranty fee factor for a pool (expressed in basis points) is determined by multiplying the issue date principal balance of each mortgage loan in the pool (or, in subsequent months, the
Published February 5, 2025
974
“scheduled” balance of each mortgage loan) by the applicable guaranty fee rate for the mortgage loan expressed in basis points (adjusted for any remittance cycle adjustments, buyup, or buydown, if applicable), then:
summing the products of all the mortgage loans in the pool,
dividing that sum by the aggregate issue date principal balance for the pool (or, in subsequent months, by the “scheduled” security balance for the pool), and
rounding the result to the nearest hundredth of a basis point.
The result is the annualized weighted-average guaranty fee factor for a pool.
Determining the Monthly Guaranty Fee Remittance for the Pool
The annualized weighted-average guaranty fee factor is then
multiplied by the aggregate issue date principal balance of the pool (or, in subsequent months, the “scheduled” security balance for the pool),
divided by 120,000, and
rounded to two decimal places.
The result is monthly guaranty fee remittance for the pool.
Remitting Guaranty Fees to Fannie Mae
On the 7th day of each month (or, if the 7th is a holiday or weekend, on the preceding business day), Fannie Mae will draft guaranty fee remittances from the custodial bank account the lender designates as its draft account.
If the guaranty fee remittance is to be drafted from the lender’s P&I custodial account for MBS pools, then the lender must make sure that it does not withdraw the guaranty fee remittance when it takes its monthly servicing fee from the account.
For more information about designating bank accounts for drafting purposes and conﬁrming guaranty fee remittances, see the Servicing Guide.

C3-3-02, Accessing Buyup and Buydown Ratios and Calculating
Payments or Charges (12/04/2019)
Introduction This topic provides information lenders need in order to buy up or buy down their guaranty fee, including:
General Information on Buyups General Information on Buydowns Accessing Buyup and Buydown Ratios Calculating Buyup Payments and Buydown Charges Buyup Payment Recapture
General Information on Buyups
Loan level guaranty fee buyups and buydowns allow lenders to pool a wider range of note rates under one MBS coupon. Lenders can buy up guaranty fees, meaning they agree to remit a guaranty fee higher than the contractual fee applicable for the particular servicing option and remittance cycle in return for a one-time payment from Fannie Mae.
Fannie Mae disburses payment for buyups to lenders once a month in a single cash transfer covering all of the lender’s mortgages with buyups that were in pools for which securities were issued in the previous month.
General Information on Buydowns
Lenders can buy down or agree to remit a lower guaranty fee than the applicable contract fee in exchange for a one-time, upfront payment to Fannie Mae.
When Fannie Mae drafts the lender’s monthly guaranty fee remittances, it also will draft charges for buydowns on pooled loans for which securities were issued in the previous month. Generally, lenders must place buydown funds into a T&I escrow account. If buydown funds (or subsidy payments or other advance payments made by the borrower) are directed for immediate application under the mortgage documents, the lender may deposit these amounts directly into the P&I custodial account.
If a lender holds MBS certiﬁcates and the buydown account and its attorneys believe there are tax complications, the lender may deposit the funds in a special account with another institution that meets Fannie Mae’s requirements for custodial depositories. For more information, see Fannie Mae’s Servicing Guide.
If a lender buys down a guaranty fee but does not service the associated mortgage, Fannie Mae establishes a receivable in the lender’s name. The lender must deposit the funds into a designated account in time for Fannie Mae to draft the funds on the seventh calendar day of the month (or the preceding business day if the seventh is a holiday or weekend) following the issue date of the related MBS pool.
Accessing Buyup and Buydown Ratios
Published February 5, 2025
976
Fannie Mae posts guaranty fee buyup/buydown ratios for nearly all mortgage products in a matrix format that enables a lender to ﬁnd the applicable buyup or buydown ratio for any individual mortgage that it plans to include in an MBS pool by using the gross note rate and remaining term (in months) of the mortgage.
Information concerning guaranty fee buyup or buydown ratios can come from several diﬀerent sources. For example,
registered users of PE-MBS can obtain them on the day they are posted by accessing PE-MBS, and
lenders may request a copy of the posted ratios from their Fannie Mae customer account team.
Refer to Fannie Mae’s website for information about the buyup and buydown grids.
Calculating Buyup Payments and Buydown Charges
The total buyup disbursement or buydown charge is calculated as follows:
multiply the number of basis points by which each mortgage in a given pool was bought up/down (the diﬀerence between the “guaranty fee rate before the buyup or buydown” and the “guaranty fee rate after the buyup/buydown”) by the “buyup/buydown per basis point” (rounding to three decimal places),
multiply the rounded product by 0.0001 to convert the basis points to a decimal equivalent, and
multiply the decimal equivalent by the delivered unpaid principal balance with a guaranty fee rate buyup/buydown.
Do this for all pools that include mortgages with guaranty fee rate buyups/buydowns and settled in the month. The total of the buyups or buydowns for all of the pools will be the amount Fannie Mae collects, disburses, or nets.
Buyup Payment Recapture
With respect to any mortgage loan that pays oﬀ within 120 days from the MBS issue date that involved a guaranty fee buyup, Fannie Mae reserves the right to request reimbursement of any or all buyup proceeds paid by Fannie Mae.
For mortgage loans repurchased by a lender, Fannie Mae in its sole discretion may require reimbursement by the lender of any buyup proceeds paid by Fannie Mae in connection with the purchase of the related repurchased mortgage loan without regard to the 120–day limitation.

The guaranty fee cannot be bought up more than 0.25% (25 basis points) nor bought down to a number less than zero.
Eligibility Requirements for ARM Guaranty Fee Buyups and Buydowns
A lender may buy up or buy down the guaranty fee remittance for MBS pools consisting of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) originated under any standard ARM plan, as long as the mortgages meet the following eligibility criteria:
The guaranty fee rate may be bought up or bought down in increments of 0.0001% (one one-hundredth of a basis point).
Any buyup or buydown of the guaranty fee remittance rate for adjustable-rate MBS pools must be calculated on the reduced guaranty fee remittance rate that applies to this type of remittance cycle.
Guaranty Fee Buyup Maximums and Buydown Minimums for ARMs
The weighted-average coupon of the pooled mortgages must not exceed the following limits:
1.000% (100 basis points) higher than the accrual rate (the pass-through rate) for the pool as of the issue date for mortgages originated under most ARM plans; or
0.875% (87.5 basis points for mortgages originated under ARM plans that have initial ﬁxed-rate periods of 3, 5, 7, or 10 years).
The recommended maximum allowable interest rate is 100 basis points (1%) over the minimum allowable

Published February 5, 2025
981
ARM Flex pools provide interest accruals at a weighted-average pool accrual rate to the holders of securities backed by the ARMs in the pool. These pools may be delivered only as single pool transactions and diﬀerent standard ARM plans may not be commingled in the same pool.
The original term of an ARM included in a weighted-average ARM MBS pool must be no more than 30 years. Each mortgage must accrue interest in arrears and have a payment due date of the ﬁrst day of the month. There is no restriction on the range of ﬁrst payment due dates, interest rate change dates, and payment change dates.
To limit the eﬀect that prepayments have on the weighted-average pool accrual rate of an ARM Flex, lenders should consider limiting to 1% (100 basis points) the range between the lowest and highest mortgage margins and the lowest and highest mortgage interest rate ceilings of all the mortgages in the pool.
ARM Flex Pool Accrual Rate Calculation Options
Under the ARM Flex pooling structure, lenders may create a weighted-average ARM MBS using either the
ﬁxed MBS margin or
weighted-average MBS margin.
The diﬀerence between the two margin types is the method used to determine the interest rate that accrues on the pool and the retained servicing fee. The ﬁxed MBS margin option is based on a pool-level MBS margin and a loan-level servicing fee. This means that when the pooled mortgages have diﬀerent mortgage margins, the servicing fees for the mortgages vary in order to equalize the diﬀerences in the mortgage margins. While the guaranty fee remains the same, the servicing spread (the sum of the servicing fee and the guaranty fee and, if applicable the periodic renewal premium for lender-purchased mortgage insurance) diﬀers from mortgage to mortgage.
The ﬁxed MBS margin applies to each mortgage in the weighted-average ARM MBS; therefore, the lowest mortgage margin in the pool must be able to, at least, support the sum of the MBS margin, the guaranty fee, and the minimum allowable servicing fee. The periodic renewal premium for lender-purchased mortgage insurance must also be included, if applicable.
The weighted-average MBS margin option is based on a pool-level servicing fee and a loan-level MBS margin, which means that when the mortgages in the pool have diﬀerent mortgage margins, the servicing spread will be equal for all the mortgages, but the MBS margin will vary from mortgage to mortgage.

To develop a ﬁxed MBS margin, the lender must ﬁrst derive a loan-level servicing fee by reducing the mortgage margin for each mortgage to be included in the pool by the desired ﬁxed MBS margin and then by the applicable guaranty fee percentage and, if applicable, by the periodic renewal premium for lender-purchased mortgage insurance. The diﬀerences in the servicing fees for the mortgages in the pool will be exactly equal to the diﬀerences in their mortgage margins. The weighted-average pool accrual rate is then determined by ﬁrst reducing each individual mortgage interest rate by the servicing spread for the mortgage (the sum of the

guaranty fee and the calculated loan-level servicing fee and, if applicable, the periodic renewal premium for lender-purchased mortgage insurance) and then developing a weighted-average of the net mortgage interest rates. This same procedure also is used to establish the maximum weighted-average pool accrual rate (and any applicable minimum weighted-average pool accrual rate), using the weighted-average of the net mortgage interest rate ceilings (or ﬂoors) of the mortgages in the pool.

C3-5-04, Pooling ARMs with a Conversion Option (05/01/2019)
Introduction This topic provides information on pooling ARMs with conversion options, including
ARM Conversion Options Redelivering a Converted ARM that Originally Required Recourse or Credit Enhancement
ARM Conversion Options
If a borrower chooses to convert an adjustable-rate mortgage that includes an option to convert to a ﬁxed-rate mortgage, the lender must repurchase the mortgage from the MBS pool before interest begins accruing at the new ﬁxed rate. Lenders may choose from two options for disposing of the converted mortgage after it has been repurchased from the pool:
take-out option
market rate option
If the take-out post-conversion option was selected when the convertible ARM was delivered, the servicer must redeliver the converted mortgage to Fannie Mae as a whole loan or as part of a ﬁxed-rate MBS (A/A remittance type only).
The take-out option is not available on mortgages that have lender-purchased mortgage insurance or were originated under an ARM plan that permits conversion to a ﬁxed interest rate only on speciﬁed interest rate adjustment dates.
The conversion option selected for each convertible ARM delivered to Fannie Mae must be identiﬁed by the appropriate special feature code:
SFC 037 Convertible ARM — Take-Out Option, or
SFC 038 Convertible ARM — Market Rate Option.
In order to receive a par price on a redelivered converted mortgage, the lender must obtain a take-out mandatory delivery commitment (Converted ARM Resale Commitment) by the 16th day of the month in which the conversion was requested.
If the market rate option was chosen, the servicer is not required to redeliver the mortgage to Fannie Mae, although it may choose to redeliver the mortgage as a whole loan (A/A, S/A or S/S remittance types) or as part of a ﬁxed-rate MBS. It may deliver the loan under any existing standard ﬁxed-rate whole loan or MBS
Published February 5, 2025
990
commitment that it has outstanding, as long as Fannie Mae’s original acceptance of the mortgage was not conditional on the lender providing some type of special recourse or credit enhancement.
Redelivering a Converted ARM that Originally Required Recourse or Credit Enhancement
If Fannie Mae originally required recourse or credit enhancement on an ARM that includes an option to convert to a ﬁxed-rate mortgage, and the conditions that led to its requirement still exist, then lenders will not be able to use a standard commitment to redeliver the converted mortgage to Fannie Mae. Instead, lenders must
obtain a new negotiated contract (which may or may not require recourse or credit enhancement) or
include the converted mortgage as part of a delivery under an outstanding negotiated contract that has acceptable recourse or credit enhancement.
If the conditions that led to Fannie Mae requiring recourse or credit enhancement no longer exist, and Fannie Mae determines that the recourse or credit enhancement is no longer necessary, lenders may redeliver the converted mortgage under
a standard whole loan commitment, or
a standard MBS commitment.

ARMs originated under diﬀerent ARM plans cannot be commingled in the same pool. In certain cases, however, lenders may be permitted to pool seasoned ARMs in ARM plans with shorter initial ﬁxed-rate periods. Interested lenders should contact their Fannie Mae customer account team to determine what ﬂexibility may be available for a speciﬁc situation.
ARMs originated under a single ARM plan, but with diﬀerent post-conversion disposition options (market rate option or take-out option) cannot be included in the same pool.

Chapter C3-6, Pooling Loans into Fannie Majors
Introduction
Lenders can pool mortgages into two types of MBS, which includes UMBS: Single-Issuer and Fannie Majors. This chapter provides information on pooling loans into Fannie Majors.
C3-6-01, Parameters for Pooling Loans Into Fannie Majors
(09/04/2024)
Introduction This topic contains general parameters for pooling loans into Fannie Majors, including:
Fannie Majors Overview Obtaining Fannie Majors Pool Numbers Selecting Mortgages to Include in a Fannie Majors Pool Selecting a Settlement Date and Security Issuance Making Multiple Submissions
Fannie Majors Overview
Fannie Majors are pools of loans that are contributed by more than one lender. Lenders participating in a Fannie Majors pool receive an MBS representing its share of the pool in proportion to the dollar amount of mortgages it
Published February 5, 2025
992
contributed to the pool.
Obtaining Fannie Majors Pool Numbers
The pool number identiﬁes the pools in which a lender’s loans are included. Fannie Mae assigns Fannie Majors pool numbers based on loan term, pass-through rate, and the month of issuance. Pool numbers, CUSIP numbers, and pass-through rates are posted on the Fannie Majors page on Fannie Mae's website and on the various wire services.
Selecting Mortgages to Include in a Fannie Majors Pool
When deciding which mortgages to include in a Fannie Majors pool, lenders must make sure that:
the mortgage conforms to the appropriate product type,
the mortgage has the appropriate seasoning,
the note rate is within the minimum and maximum range in relation to the pass-through rate, and
the minimum submission size is satisﬁed.
To be eligible for a Fannie Majors pool, mortgages may be no older than 11 months as of the security issue date. For example, all loans to be included in a December 2019 pool, must have ﬁrst payment dates on or after January 2019.
As with single-lender, ﬁxed-rate MBS pools, the minimum and maximum allowable interest rate within a Fannie Majors pool is 25 basis points (.25%) and 112.5 basis points (1.125%) respectively above the pool’s pass- through rate. Lenders can use loan-level buyups and buydowns to eliminate excess servicing and, in the case of buydowns, include loans in a higher coupon.
Fannie Majors have a minimum submission requirement of $1,000 when lenders deliver the loan to Fannie Mae.
To qualify for a Fannie Mae Green Majors pool, loans must meet Green MBS eligibility standards and have an eligible green building certiﬁcation. See C1-2-05, Delivering Green MBS to Fannie Mae for additional details.
Selecting a Settlement Date and Security Issuance
Lenders may choose their own settlement date for a Fannie Majors pool. If a lender makes several submissions into the same Fannie Majors pool, it may select diﬀerent settlement dates for each.
Fannie Mae can issue securities in book-entry form within three business days after the lender submits a complete, error-free pool documentation package via Loan Delivery, as long as Fannie Mae receives:
the lender’s transmission of the loan delivery data by 6:00 p.m. (Eastern time), and
the transmission of the document custodian’s pool certiﬁcation by 10:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on the day following the lender’s Loan Delivery transmission.
See C3-7-06, Settling the Trade, for additional information on turnaround times.
Published February 5, 2025
993
A lender delivering into Fannie Majors receives securities rounded to the lowest whole dollar amount of the loans it contributed to the pool, unless it requests otherwise. Fannie Mae issues certiﬁcates in minimum denominations of $1,000 with additional increments of one dollar. Only one security denomination can be issued for each account.
Making Multiple Submissions
A lender may deliver several diﬀerent pieces for inclusion in a multiple pool (Fannie Majors) as long as all of the pieces have the same remittance cycle. This means that delivery of multiple servicer numbers per seller number is permitted in a Fannie Majors pool; however each piece must have one seller/servicer combination. In addition, each piece must be submitted separately and must meet the $1,000 minimum submission requirement.
Fannie Mae will combine the submissions with the same branch seller/servicer number and remittance day into the same pool under the same lender. These loans must be serviced as one pool after issuance. The dollar amount of the lender’s securities will be equal to the sum of the issue date principal balances of all the mortgages from each of the lender’s pool documentation packages related to the multiple pool, rounded down to the next lowest whole dollar amount.
Lenders may deliver nonstandard loans into Fannie Majors MBS pools. Each discrete delivery the lender makes under a given Fannie Majors TBA–eligible UMBS pool will be subject to the limitations that apply to a single TBA–eligible UMBS pool. See C3-2-01, Determining Eligibility for Loans Pooled into MBS for additional information.

To establish a trading account, the lender may call the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk.
See E-1-02, List of Contacts.
Each lender must provide the following information:
either a corporate resolution from its board of directors or an oﬃcer’s certiﬁcate to indicate
2
its authority to establish a trading account with the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk;
and
the names of the designated individuals who will be authorized to sell securities to, or to buy
them from, the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk and the limit of their authority (if any).
Published February 5, 2025
995
Stage
Description
Each lender must provide an address that can be used for all oﬃcial notices and
3
communications sent to the lender, and wiring instructions for the diﬀerent types of payments
Fannie Mae makes to the lender.
The lender must continue to provide updates about any changes to its authority to perform
4
under the trading account, the individuals authorized to transact business with the Capital
Markets Pricing and Sales Desk (or their limits of authority), and the lender’s address or wiring
instructions.
Requirements and Terms Governing the Trading Account
A lender’s trading account is governed by the terms of its Mortgage Selling and Servicing Contract (MSSC), the provisions of this Guide and any special instructions provided for in a speciﬁc trade conﬁrmation or settlement notice.
By initiating trade activity with the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk, lenders agree to adhere to Fannie Mae’s guidelines for selling securities and to SIFMA's Uniform Practices for the Clearance and Settlement of Mortgage-Backed Securities and Other Related Securities, including any amendments to either. Should there be a conﬂict between the requirements in this Guide and the SIFMA provisions, the requirements of this Guide take precedence.
As security for payment of its obligations and liabilities under its trading account, the lender grants Fannie Mae a ﬁrst priority security interest in any and all of its right, title, and interest in its securities, money, or other property that is held for (or by) Fannie Mae.
If appropriate authorities require the ﬁling of a ﬁnancing statement to evidence this security interest, the lender must execute and deliver any legal instruments required to protect or perfect Fannie Mae’s security interest.
Terms and Conditions Governing Use of the Electronic Trading Platform
By accessing Fannie Mae’s electronic trading platform, currently known as the MBS Trading Portal, the lender agrees that the platform will be a “Licensed Application,” as deﬁned in the Software Subscription Agreement General Terms and Conditions. See the Consolidated Technology Guide. The lender also agrees that it is subject to the General Terms and Conditions, and that the following additional terms apply.
Authorized User For purposes of the electronic trading platform, the term “Authorized User” includes individuals:
working for Third-Party Providers retained by the lender to perform mortgage-related services requiring access to the Licensed Application on the lender’s behalf or third-party originators (such as mortgage brokers or correspondents that are aﬃliated with lender) that require access to the Licensed Application; and
who have obtained Authentication Credentials as a result of the lender’s actions.
Published February 5, 2025
996
The lender agrees that actions of Authorized Users are deemed to be actions of the lender.
Evidence of a Trade The Licensed Application’s conﬁrmation of a trade as “Accepted,” together with the Selling Guide and any applicable MBS trading agreement between lender and Fannie Mae, the conclusive evidence of a trade and the terms between Fannie Mae and lender with respect to the trade described in the conﬁrmation.
Indicative Pricing If indicative pricing is displayed to the lender, the lender acknowledges and understands that such pricing is not the actual pricing and is subject to increase or decrease prior to acceptance of the trade.
Termination of Relationships Fannie Mae reserves the right to immediately suspend or terminate any relationship established between a lender and a third party by and for the Licensed Application at any time, in its sole discretion.
Establishment of Trading Limits and Margin Requirements
When Fannie Mae establishes a trading account for a lender, it may establish trading limits, margin requirements, a designated threshold amount, and a minimum transfer amount speciﬁc to a lender.
After a trading account is established for a lender, Fannie Mae may:
amend or cancel any trading limits, margin requirements, designated threshold amounts, or minimum transfer amounts initially imposed on a lender’s trading accounts; and
decline to engage in any speciﬁc transaction with the lender.
Oﬀsetting Price Diﬀerentials
Subject to the applicable designated threshold amount and minimum transfer amount (deﬁned below), a lender and Fannie Mae may elect to exchange variation margin if there is a price diﬀerential on the lender’s open (unsettled) trades with Fannie Mae.
A price diﬀerential exists if, at any time, with respect to a lender’s open trades with the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk, either party would incur a loss if it canceled the open trades and entered into replacement transactions (i.e., there is a diﬀerence between the current market price and the settlement price of the open trades). If a price diﬀerential exists, the party that would receive positive income from the cancellation of the open trades and entry into replacement transactions is “in the money,” and the party that would incur a cost from the cancellation of the open trades and entry into replacement transactions is “out of the money.”
If there is a negative price diﬀerential for a lender’s open trades with the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk (i.e., on any trading day, the lender is “out of the money” with regard to the securities it has contracted to purchase or sell to Fannie Mae), then Fannie Mae may request that the lender wire cash to Fannie Mae, subject to the lender’s designated threshold amount and minimum transfer amount.
If there is a positive price diﬀerential for a lender’s open trades with the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk (i.e., on any trading day, the lender is “in the money” with regard to the securities the lender has contracted to purchase or sell to Fannie Mae), then the lender may request that Fannie Mae wire cash to the lender, subject to Fannie Mae’s designated threshold amount and minimum transfer amount.
Published February 5, 2025
997
When calculating the price diﬀerential:
any open trades between the lender and the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk will be disregarded if they have been assigned, submitted, transferred, or reported to a securities clearing organization (e.g., the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation) for clearing, netting, and/or settlement such that the open trade will be factored into the applicable margin requirements of such securities clearing organization; and
any outstanding pair-oﬀ fees relating to trades between the lender and the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk will be factored into the calculation of the price diﬀerential.
Designated Threshold Amount and Minimum Transfer Amount
The designated threshold amount represents a level of unsecured exposure an “in the money” party will accept before making a margin call on the “out of the money” party. Fannie Mae’s designated threshold amount and a lender’s designated threshold amount shall each be $3,000,000, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing and/or subject to the occurrence of a triggering event as discussed below.
Example
If there is a positive price diﬀerential and a lender is in the money by $3,100,000, the lender may make a margin call to Fannie Mae for $100,000. ($3,100,000 – Fannie Mae’s designated threshold amount of $3,000,000).
A minimum transfer is a speciﬁed amount of money that must be exceeded before a margin call can be made. Fannie Mae’s minimum transfer amount and a lender’s minimum transfer amount shall each be $50,000, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing and/or subject to the occurrence of a triggering event as discussed below.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Fannie Mae will not wire cash to a lender in the event of a positive price diﬀerential if any of the following “triggering events” has occurred with respect to a lender:
an event of default under the Lender Contract or any other contract between Fannie Mae and the lender,
the lender’s failure to meet any of the lender eligibility requirements set forth in Subpart A-4, Maintaining Lender Eligibility,
a decline in a lender’s adjusted net worth by more than 20% over a quarterly reporting period or by more than 30% over two consecutive quarterly periods,
the total unpaid principal balance of all outstanding Fannie Mae repurchase requests to a lender exceeds 15% of the lender’s adjusted net worth,
Fannie Mae comes into possession of information that, in Fannie Mae’s reasonable discretion, could result in an adverse impact, either presently or in the future, on the lender’s counterparty relationship with Fannie Mae or the lender’s ﬁnancial condition, or
outstanding contractual fees owed by a lender to Fannie Mae.
Further, upon occurrence of a triggering event for a lender, Fannie Mae, in its sole and absolute discretion, may modify or eliminate the designated threshold amount and minimum transfer amount applicable to such lender without prior notice to the lender.

Default of Lender Under the Terms of Trading Account
Under the terms of the trading account, certain events could result in the lender being in default. A lender is in default if Fannie Mae determines, at any time, that any of the representations that were made regarding the lender’s ability (or that of a designated authorized individual) to transact business is incorrect or untrue in any material respect, or if the lender:
initiates a case or proceeding (or has a suit brought against it) under any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or similar law;
seeks the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, or similar oﬃcial for itself or any substantial part of its property;
executes a general assignment for the beneﬁt of its creditors;
admits in writing that it does not have the ability to pay its debts as they come due;
is subject to an outstanding, uncontested order of relief or a protective decree issued under the Securities Investor Protection Act; or
fails to perform as required. Instances of nonperformance that constitute a default include the failure to:
perform any of the obligations set out in a conﬁrmation or settlement notice;
perform any obligations with respect to completing a trade (or the admission that it is unable or unwilling to do so);
perform obligations under any other agreement or contract it has with Fannie Mae;
if notice is sent by Fannie Mae by 10:00 a.m. on a business day, satisfy the price diﬀerential on lender’s trades with the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk by the close of business on that same business day; or
if notice is sent by Fannie Mae after 10:00 a.m. on a business day, satisfy the price diﬀerential on lender’s trades with the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk by 12:00 noon on the next business day.
Consequences of a Default
A default with respect to one transaction will constitute a default for all of the lender’s transactions with the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk. See E-1-02, List of Contacts.
The lender’s payments, deliveries, and transfers for one transaction may be applied (“netted”) against the lender’s other transactions.
Fannie Mae also may treat a default under the lender’s trading account as a default under the lender’s MSSC.
When that is the case, the provisions for “termination (of a selling or servicing arrangement or the contract) for cause” that are set out in A2-3.1-01, Lender Breach of Contract, will apply.
Remedies for the Default of a Lender’s Trading Account

Note: The interest charged will be based upon the prime rate for commercial banks that is published in The Wall Street Journal.
Published February 5, 2025

If necessary, Fannie Mae may liquidate and apply against the obligations the lender owes as the result of its default, any and all of the lender’s securities, money, and other property that is held for (or by) Fannie Mae.
Suitability and Risk of Loss
The risk of loss when transacting with the Capital Market Pricing and Sales Desk can be substantial. A lender should carefully consider whether a transaction is suitable in light of its ﬁnancial condition, its investment objectives, and any legal or regulatory restrictions to which it may be subject. The market value for the securities to be purchased or sold by a lender can vary substantially over the term of a transaction. A lender should carefully consider if it has the operational resources in place to monitor the risks and contractual obligations of a transaction, including the risk that Fannie Mae may request that a lender post margin to satisfy a price diﬀerential on the same or the following business day.
By agreeing to a conﬁrmation, the lender is deemed to have represented and warranted that it understands the risks associated with the transaction with the Capital Market Pricing and Sales Desk, and the lender believes that the transaction is suitable for the lender. Similarly, to the extent that the lender assigns or transfers any of its rights and obligations under any transaction, the lender shall be deemed to represent and warrant as of the date of such assignment that the lender has reasonable grounds to believe that any such assigned transaction is a suitable transaction for the assignee. Fannie Mae and the lender agree that, if any rights and obligations are so assigned by the lender, notwithstanding any consent to such assignment by Fannie Mae, Fannie Mae shall have no obligation to undertake an evaluation of the suitability of the assigned rights and obligations to the assignee.
Before engaging in any transactions with the Capital Market Pricing and Sales Desk, a lender should consult its own business, legal, tax, risk, accounting, and other advisers and examine the provisions in this Chapter of the Guide to determine whether the risks to the lender are appropriate.
Transactional Intent of the Lender and Fannie Mae
The lender acknowledges, at all times, that Fannie Mae is not acting as a ﬁduciary or an advisor with respect to any transaction with the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk.
The lender and Fannie Mae also agree that transactions between the lender and the Capital Market Pricing and Sales Desk are intended to be:
”forward contracts,” “securities contracts, ” and “master netting agreements,” as such terms are deﬁned in the United States Bankruptcy Code, as amended, and of a type set forth in Section 5390(c)(8)(D) or Title 12, as amended;
“qualiﬁed ﬁnancial contracts,” if the lender is an “insured depository institution” under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended; and
a “netting contract” as deﬁned in and subject to Title IV of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, as amended, and each payment entitlement and payment obligation under any transaction shall constitute a “covered contractual payment entitlement” or “covered contractual payment obligation, respectively, as such terms are deﬁned in such Act.
The lender and Fannie Mae also agree that either party’s rights to cancel a transaction or exercise any other

remedies upon a default is a contractual right to liquidate such transaction as described in Section 555 and 556 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as amended, and a right to terminate, liquidate, or accelerate as described in Sections 5390(c)(8)(A) and (C) of Title 12 of the United States Code, as amended.

C3-7-02, Initiating an MBS Sale (07/07/2021)
Introduction This topic describes the steps lenders take to initiate an MBS, including UMBS, sale via Fannie Mae’s Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk, including:
Determining the Trade Type Checking Market Prices Selecting a Settlement Date Selecting a Settlement Method Requesting and Accepting a Firm Bid/Oﬀer
Determining the Trade Type
If a lender sells MBS, its trade may be TBA or speciﬁed. With a TBA trade, the lender may deliver any UMBS meeting eligibility requirements as deﬁned by SIFMA. A speciﬁed trade means that a speciﬁc MBS is being traded and only that security can be delivered in satisfaction of the trade. TBA trades settle on the SIFMA settlement dates (see Pool Settlement Dates).
Checking Market Prices
See C3-1-01, General Information About Fannie Mae’s MBS Program, for information on MBS prices and their determinants. Prices of Fannie Mae MBS are quoted in 32nds of a percent for both immediate and forward delivery issues.
Published February 5, 2025
1002
Selecting a Settlement Date
The lender must plan its settlement date to be sure it can deliver the securities as scheduled. In particular, the lender must allow suﬃcient time after loan closing for the processing of the documentation package. Any errors in the package can result in a delay in settlement.
Lenders may settle trades for newly issued securities on any day of the month in which they are issued. When a trade is settled on a “regular” settlement date, it will occur on a date that is predetermined by SIFMA, based on a schedule that changes periodically.
Note: Settlements cannot occur on holidays.
Selecting a Settlement Method
The method of funding the sale of a security depends on the settlement method the lender chooses when delivering the pool to Fannie Mae. Lenders that want to use an early funding settlement option such as As Soon As Pooled Sale (for pools) or As Soon As Pooled Plus (for whole loans) must execute a special agreement that provides the speciﬁc terms for the type of transaction it is using. Lenders interested in using an early funding settlement option should contact the Capital Market Sales Desk. See E-1-02, List of Contacts.
For newly issued securities, if a lender opts for an “original issue” settlement instead of “delivery vs. payment,” lenders must specify Fannie Mae’s account in the wiring instructions on the Delivery Schedule (Form 2014) it submits when the pool is delivered. Lenders using this option must follow SIFMA’s guidelines and submit notiﬁcation 48 hours prior to settlement.
Existing MBS must be funded through “delivery vs. payment” (or a “delivery against funds” or “existing issue”) settlement option. Under this settlement option, when Fannie Mae receives the security, it credits the lender’s account at the institution that wires the security to the Desk.
If a lender has not sold the securities to an investor before it delivers loans to Fannie Mae and has not elected to use the “original issue” settlement option, Fannie Mae will issue the securities to the lender.
Requesting and Accepting a Firm Bid/Oﬀer
When contacting the Desk to request a ﬁrm bid/oﬀer, the lender must be prepared to specify the following information:
MBS product,
amount of the trade,
coupon rate,
settlement date,
unique characteristics of the pool that will back the security.
Fannie Mae’s Sales Desk will convey a bid/oﬀer for the security to the lender. If the lender accepts the ﬁrm bid or ﬁrm oﬀer, the Sales Desk will lock in the bid or oﬀer and verify the trade details in a recorded telephone
Published February 5, 2025
1003
conversation with the lender.
That evening, Fannie Mae will send the lender a written conﬁrmation statement that includes the details of the trade such as the trade number, date, amount, price, the coupon rate, and the settlement date. The conﬁrmation, taken together with the relevant sections of this Guide, constitutes conclusive evidence of the terms between Fannie Mae and the lender for the respective trade, unless the lender notiﬁes the Operations team of any errors in the conﬁrmation by close of trading on the next trading day. Lenders will be responsible for any resulting economic diﬀerences from a trade if they fail to notify Fannie Mae of any errors in the conﬁrmation within the speciﬁed window.
Note: For lenders executing trades with Fannie Mae via Fannie Mae’s electronic trading platform, the lender’s trade details for the bid or oﬀer will be available through the platform using appropriate login credentials.

C3-7-03, Making Good Delivery (05/01/2019)
Introduction This topic describes the requirements for making good delivery of MBS, (which includes UMBS), including:
Good Delivery Conditions Principal Amount of the Trade Accrued Interest Maximum Number of Pools and Minimum Delivery Amounts Pairing Oﬀ
Good Delivery Conditions
Acceptance of a ﬁrm bid to sell MBS to the Desk is an enforceable obligation that requires the lender to deliver the security at the parameters agreed upon at the time of the trade and in amount that meets the minimum trade requirements for the commitment. When a lender meets this obligation, it has made good delivery.
Published February 5, 2025
1004
However, a good delivery for Fannie Mae’s purposes and a good delivery that satisﬁes SIFMA's guidelines for a TBA trade are not always the same. The guidelines that determine whether a lender has or has not made good delivery for a TBA trade include the following:
The delivery of a single-lender MBS under a ﬁrm bid that speciﬁed a Fannie Majors multiple-lender MBS does not constitute good delivery for that trade. The delivery of a Fannie Majors UMBS, however, will be considered good delivery for a TBA trade under any ﬁrm bid, even if the lender did not specify that the trade would include a Fannie Majors UMBS.
The delivery of a 30-year term UMBS against a TBA trade that speciﬁes a 30-year UMBS will not be considered as a good delivery unless the ﬁnal maturity date of the security was greater than 181 months when the security was issued.
The delivery of an MBS backed by pools that are comprised of more than 10% of any single type of nonstandard loan or more than 15% of any combination of nonstandard loans is not considered a good delivery for a TBA trade. See C3-2-01, Determining Eligibility for Loans Pooled into MBS for additional information about pooling nonstandard loans.
Failure to eﬀect a good delivery of a security for a TBA trade can severely limit a lender’s ability to deal with the Desk and could result in Fannie Mae declaring the lender to be in default. See C3-7-01, Establishing an MBS Trading Account, for more details.
See C3-7-04, Delivering MBS Pool Data and Documents, for speciﬁcs on the data and documents required in order to make good delivery.
Principal Amount of the Trade
The maximum diﬀerence between the principal balance the lender committed to deliver and the amount actually delivered can be plus or minus 0.01% of the trade amount for a TBA trade. If multiple trades are executed against a single pool transmission, the delivery variance applies to each trade.
Lenders that need a higher or lower variance in some situations should contact the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk to negotiate an alternative variance. Lenders should note, however, that trades that have variances outside of SIFMA's tolerances will not be eligible for TBA trades. Also, no variance is allowed for transactions in which the seller provides the buyer with a pool number and speciﬁc original face amount on the date the two parties agree to enter into the transaction. For funding purposes, the principal amount is calculated as follows:
a = d x b, where
a = net principal
d = current balance of the security
b = price (in decimals)
Accrued Interest
Published February 5, 2025
1005
Accrued interest is paid up to, but not including, the settlement date. Therefore, if the settlement occurs on the ﬁrst of the month, the current amount due does not include an accrued interest payment. For funding purposes, the accrued interest amount is calculated based on the following formula:
c = [d x e/360 days] x (f – 1 day), where
c = interest
d = current balance of the security
e = the pass-through rate
f = the settlement date
Maximum Number of Pools and Minimum Delivery Amounts
The maximum number of pools permitted for delivery into a given trade depends on:
the MBS pass-through rate,
the amount of the trade, and
the number of pools that are needed to reach the minimum delivery amount (which is determined by the applicable trade delivery variance). The current minimum balance for each pool in a group submission must be at least $25,000.
The limits are described in the following table:
MBS Pass-Through Rate

Maximum Number of Pools

Pairing Oﬀ
If a lender is having diﬃculty meeting its commitment to deliver a security, the Desk may permit the lender to execute a “pair-oﬀ.” The lender should request a pair-oﬀ well in advance of the scheduled settlement date to avoid a “failed” delivery.
To request a pair-oﬀ, a lender may either:
request a “ﬁrm oﬀer” from the Desk, identifying the trade to be paired oﬀ. A ﬁrm oﬀer will enable the lender to buy from the Desk (at current market value) an MBS that is comparable to the one the lender agreed to sell to the Desk, or
arrange a transaction with a third party whereby the lender purchases the MBS from that party and delivers it to the Desk in fulﬁllment of its commitment.
Pair-oﬀs are not always possible in certain market environments; therefore, a lender should evaluate market conditions before considering their use.
The lender must wire pair-oﬀ funds to Fannie Mae on the settlement date. If the lender owes Fannie Mae pair-oﬀ funds from two or more related buy and sell transactions that settle on the same day, it should remit a single wire for the net amount due to Fannie Mae. The wire transfer must include the lender’s name, the settlement date, and the word “pair-oﬀ.”
Fannie Mae has the right to charge interest on delinquent funds.

Introduction This topic includes speciﬁcs on pool data and documentation delivery requirements, including:
Required Documents for MBS Pool Loans General MBS Pool Delivery Requirements MBS Pool Data Delivery Requirements MBS Pool Document Delivery Requirements As Soon As Pooled Plus Loan Deliveries and Redeliveries as As Soon As Pooled Plus Pools
Required Documents for MBS Pool Loans
See E-2-01, Required Custodial Documents for a list of mortgage documents that should be included in the document submission package for all loans. C3-7-07, Sale of Fannie Mae Securities to Third Parties for additional information.
General MBS Pool Delivery Requirements
A lender must deliver the mortgage document submission package to the document custodian at the same time it transmits the loan delivery data to Fannie Mae. The submission package must be sent to the assigned document custodian and addressed according to the instructions provided by that custodian. The custodian must then complete the required loan certiﬁcation prior to pool closing, which must occur before Fannie Mae issues the related securities.
The lender must allow suﬃcient processing time between the time it submits its loan delivery data and the document submission package and the time it wants the securities to be issued in book-entry form. See C3-7-07, Sale of Fannie Mae Securities to Third Parties for additional information.
For additional information on the eligibility criteria for document custodians, see the RDC guide. For a complete list of active document custodians, refer to Fannie Mae's Active Document Custodians.
MBS Pool Data Delivery Requirements
When a lender transmits its loan delivery data, it must include a Delivery Schedule (Form 2014) for MBS pools. Form 2014 identiﬁes the parties to which the securities are to be issued. If the lender markets and sells the securities before it submits its pool documentation to Fannie Mae, it must provide instructions related to the delivery of the securities on this form. Special instructions for preparing Form 2014 are necessary for MBS delivered using the early funding option As Soon As Pooled Sale.
The lender enters loan data into Loan Delivery. Data should include the Financial Institution Number (FIN) of the applicable document custodian. When submitting loan delivery data to Fannie Mae, the lender represents and warrants that:
Published February 5, 2025
1008
the data is correct,
each loan listed is to be transferred to Fannie Mae on the book-entry delivery date of the related securities, and
the loans will be delivered and serviced in accordance with the terms of the MBS commitment and Fannie Mae’s Guides.
For information about speciﬁc FIN codes, see Loan Delivery Data Requirements.
Lenders delivering into Fannie Majors must include the Fannie Majors pool and CUSIP number in their deliveries. A lender may submit data for mortgages in the same Fannie Majors at diﬀerent times and on diﬀerent days of the month, as long as all of the mortgages submitted are the same product type and have the same remittance cycle and servicer. All Fannie Major deliveries must be error-free and certiﬁed by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time on the fourth to last business day before the end of the month.

In the following calendar example, the fourth to last business day of the month is Friday the 26th.

Lender submissions must align to the eligible settlement dates as published on the applicable Pool Settlement Calendar for the issue month of the submission. Data submission must be transmitted in Loan Delivery by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time on the published last day to submit to be eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae in that issue month. For more information on eligible settlement and submission dates, see the Loan Delivery page on Fannie Mae’s website.
Fannie Mae must have received the lender’s loan delivery data for a speciﬁc MBS pool transaction by the time it receives the document custodian’s electronic certiﬁcation for the pool. Loan delivery data is sent electronically to the document custodian and Fannie Mae at the same time, via Loan Delivery.
If the lender fails to deliver the required delivery data for any speciﬁc MBS pool transaction to Fannie Mae, Fannie Mae may terminate the related MBS commitment by giving the lender written notice of the termination. Fannie Mae will telephone the lender in advance to inform it that a written termination notiﬁcation is being sent.
MBS Pool Document Delivery Requirements
The lender must have a custodial arrangement for each MBS pool transaction it delivers to Fannie Mae. The seller must add the document custodian to its proﬁle within the Loan Delivery application. In addition, the seller must submit the FIN code for the document custodian in the delivery ﬁle. The FIN code allows the data to be routed to the proper document custodian. Failure to specify the proper FIN may result in a delay of certiﬁcation and/or MBS pool securitization. However, if an MBS pool contains one or more ASAP Plus loans, all loans within the pool must be certiﬁed by the custodian who certiﬁed the ASAP Plus delivery. See ASAP Plus Loan Deliveries
Published February 5, 2025
1009
and Redeliveries as ASAP Plus Pools below, for additional details.
Once the lender has the applicable Master Custodial Agreement (Form 2017) on ﬁle with Fannie Mae for each of the diﬀerent document custodians it uses, the lender will not need to advise Fannie Mae about the speciﬁc custodial arrangement for speciﬁc MBS pools when they are delivered. See A3-3-04, Document Custodians for additional information.
When a lender delivers loans into an MBS, it must send documentation on each mortgage to its document custodian for certiﬁcation and retention of physical custody, from that point forward, pending successful completion of the loan acquisition transaction. The seller should ensure that the mortgage document submission package is submitted to its overnight carrier (with instructions for ﬁrst morning delivery) the same day that the seller submits the loan data to Fannie Mae for purchase. Loan data delivered by the seller to Fannie Mae will be certiﬁed the next business day provided the documents have been delivered to the document custodian via ﬁrst morning delivery, and there are no discrepancies and no unresolved lien issues. See E-1-02, List of Contacts.
When the document custodian receives the mortgage document submission package, it will review the related mortgage documentation to verify all of the required documents have been received and are in order. The document custodian will then work with the lender to correct any certiﬁcation data or document errors. Lenders can opt-in to receive email notices through Loan Delivery when data or document discrepancies are noted during certiﬁcation. Lenders then have the option to accept or decline data changes the custodian proposes as a result of a discrepancy on the note and the data they provided. The lender must work with the custodian to ensure all discrepancies are resolved.
If there are no document or data-related errors, the document custodian will transmit a certiﬁcation to Fannie Mae.
As Soon As Pooled Plus Loan Deliveries and Redeliveries as As Soon As Pooled Plus Pools
In addition to the instructions above in MBS Pool Document Delivery Requirements, the following requirements also pertain to As Soon As Pooled Plus loan deliveries and redeliveries.
If sellers opt to redeliver an As Soon As Pooled Plus loan as a whole loan execution to Fannie Mae, they must redeliver the loan to Fannie Mae via Loan Delivery. When an As Soon As Pooled Plus loan is redelivered as a whole loan, sellers must include the FIN code upon redelivery. Failure to specify the proper code may result in a delay of certiﬁcation and/or purchase of the loan.
If sellers opt to redeliver an As Soon As Pooled Plus loan as an MBS execution to Fannie Mae, they should redeliver the loan to Fannie Mae via Loan Delivery.
If an MBS pool contains one or more As Soon As Pooled Plus loans, all ASAP Plus loans within the pool must be certiﬁed by the same document custodian who certiﬁed the ASAP Plus loan. In addition, the seller must transmit all of the loans in the pool with the same document custodian FIN code. The seller will need to add the document custodian to its proﬁle within the Loan Delivery application.
Failure to specify the proper FIN code may result in a delay of certiﬁcation and/or purchase of the loan.

Basic Requirements for Presettlement Information Required for Presettling Pools of Seasoned Mortgages Information Required for Presettling ARM MBS
Basic Requirements for Presettlement
When a lender sells MBS through the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk, it must call the Desk to verify trade details no later than 3:00 p.m. (Eastern time) two business days before the settlement date. This is called the notiﬁcation date.
If a lender needs to make any corrections or cancellations, it must call before 12:15 p.m. (Eastern time) on the notiﬁcation date to ensure that delivery can take place within two business days. If the call is received after this time, the delivery cannot take place until three business days after the notiﬁcation date.
Fannie Mae will accept a fax transmission of the trade details as long as the lender notiﬁes the Desk in advance about the pending transmission and the transmission is received by 3:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the notiﬁcation date. See Capital Markets Operations Collateral Management for fax number information E-1-02, List of Contacts.
After the change or deletion of the payee code has been made, Fannie Mae mails the lender a list of its outstanding payee arrangements.

If the pool is being delivered into a TBA trade, all TBA good delivery guidelines (per SIFMA) apply. These guidelines require the seller of MBS to provide the prospectus and the prospectus supplement at least 48 hours prior to TBA settlement.
If Fannie Mae cannot meet a lender’s speciﬁed book-entry date, Fannie Mae will not be responsible for any direct, indirect, or consequential damages that the lender incurs because of the delayed book-entry delivery. See C3-7-07, Sale of Fannie Mae Securities to Third Parties for additional information.
Distribution of Securities
When Fannie Mae accepts an MBS pool submission for securitization, it issues a security backed by the mortgages in the pool and delivers it electronically through the Federal Reserve Book-Entry System to an account in an institution that the lender speciﬁes. The lender’s book-entry delivery date may be the same date as settlement, but must not be later than the last day of the month in which the pool issue date occurs.
“Due Bill” for MBS Pool Settlements
A due bill is a document that the seller of a security issues to the purchaser of the security to enable the purchaser to redeem principal and interest the seller receives after the record date.
If the settlement occurs before the record date, but the delivery and payment on the trade will occur between the record date and a subsequent “payable” date, then the due bill should accompany the securities.
Published February 5, 2025
1014
If the delivery and payment occur after the payable date, then a postdated check for the amount of P&I the purchaser is due, which will serve as the due bill until the postdated date of the check, must accompany the securities. When securities are transferred over the Federal Reserve’s book-entry system, a Fedwire message is an acceptable substitute for the check. Due bill or Fedwire messages are valid for 60 days.
The purchaser may submit a due bill or Fedwire message to the seller for payment as soon as pool factors are available. As long as the request for payment is presented three or more days before a “payable” date, the seller will pay the purchaser the amount on the “payable” date. If the purchaser requests payment after that, the seller has three days from the date of the due bill or Fedwire message is presented in which to pay the purchaser.
Multiple Warehouse Lenders
Currently, Fannie Mae can only link one warehouse lender to each document custodian the lender uses for its MBS pool deliveries. Therefore, if a lender that uses only one document custodian, and assembles pools involving more than one warehouse lender (or uses diﬀerent warehouse lenders for some MBS pools), the lender will need to designate one warehouse lender to represent the interests of the other warehouse lenders it uses.
The other warehouse lenders must execute written agreements that:
give the designated warehouse lender the authority to represent them for those mortgages in MBS pools in which they have an interest; and
obligate the designated warehouse lender to take the steps necessary to ensure that they receive securities equal to their interests in the mortgages in the MBS pools, when appropriate.
Rejection of a Wire Transfer/Change of Wire Transfer Instructions
If a Fannie Mae wire transfer is rejected by a depository institution or by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Fannie Mae will contact the lender for veriﬁcation of the instructions and request that it update any information that resulted in the rejection.
To change wire transfer instructions, the lender may modify its Delivery Schedule (Form 2014) any time prior to 6:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the business day preceding the designated book-entry delivery date, except when the lender is using an early funding option or delivers a loan under a bailee letter. See C3-7-02, Initiating an MBS Sale for additional information.
If a change will aﬀect the lender’s warehouse lender, the lender should contact the warehouse lender. If the warehouse lender disagrees with the lender’s initial wire transfer instructions or any subsequent changes the lender makes to them, the warehouse lender should contact the lender. Fannie Mae will not compensate the lender or warehouse lender for any losses, costs, expenses, or damages it or another party incurs as a result of Fannie Mae’s adherence to the lender’s instructions.

C3-7-07, Sale of Fannie Mae Securities to Third Parties (05/05/2021)
Introduction This topic contains information on the sale of Fannie Mae securities to third parties, including:
Sale of Fannie Mae Securities to Third Parties Overview Required Disclosure Materials Standard Delivery Alternative Website Delivery Indemniﬁcation Against Losses
Sale of Fannie Mae Securities to Third Parties Overview
The lender must provide each purchaser of a security a copy of the most recent Fannie Mae MBS Prospectus when it enters into a contract to sell the security.
If the security purchaser requests an original printed version of the Prospectus, Prospectus Supplement, or Supplement to Prospectus Supplement, the lender must honor the request in a timely manner. Electronic versions of these documents are available at Mortgage-Backed Securities.
Copies of the prospectus and the related prospectus supplement may be obtained by writing to Trust Agreement and Prospectus Requests or by calling the Fannie Mae Delivery and Custody Helpline (see E-1-02, List of Contacts). Typically, the prospectus supplement is available no later than two business days before settlement of the related issuance of certiﬁcates.
If a newly issued pool has already been sold to a third party for future settlement, the lender is responsible for ensuring they abide by all rules related to the trade. This includes providing all necessary disclosure documents as deﬁned by the relevant trade agreement with the counterparty.
Required Disclosure Materials
The lender must provide the required disclosure documentation (described below) to a purchaser or prospective purchaser, as applicable. The lender will have two options to provide this disclosure: the lender must follow either the Standard Delivery option or the Alternative Website Delivery option, each as described below. The lender’s sale of securities—including any that Fannie Mae delivers based on the lender’s instructions on the Delivery Schedule (Form 2014) — also must comply with applicable securities disclosure and settlement requirements, including those set forth below under either the Standard Delivery option or the Alternative Website Delivery option.
For any trade, TBA or otherwise, the required disclosure consists of both the Single-Family Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement applicable to the MBS program.
Standard Delivery
Published February 5, 2025
1017
The lender must provide the required disclosure materials to each purchaser (that is, a party that enters into an agreement to purchase the security) at the time the lender enters into a contract for the purchase and sale of that security or to an oﬀeree (that is, prospective purchaser) that requests the oﬀering documentation.
The required disclosure materials are to be provided in a manner agreed to by the lender and the purchaser of a security. This may include electronic delivery or mailing of a hard copy. The materials are available on Fannie Mae's website. The lender also may obtain them by contacting the Fixed-Income Investor Helpline (see E-1-02, List of Contacts). On request, Fannie Mae will provide these documents to the lender as electronic read-only ﬁles by transmitting the ﬁles to the lender’s email address or by other electronic means.
Alternative Website Delivery
Another option to provide the required disclosure documentation is via Fannie Mae’s website. Under this option, the lender informs the purchaser or oﬀeree of a security, as applicable, that the required disclosure materials are available on Fannie Mae’s website. If the lender selects this Alternative Website Delivery option, the lender must ﬁrst deliver or cause to be delivered the following:
a Notice of Oﬀering to each oﬀeree of a security that requests the oﬀering documentation (that is, the MBS Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement for that security); and
a Notice of Sale to each purchaser of a security at the time the purchaser enters into a contract with the lender for the purchase of the security.
The Notice of Oﬀering means a notice (including an electronic notice) prepared by the lender to oﬀerees of securities. The Notice of Oﬀering must:
state that the oﬀering documentation is or will be available at Mortgage-Backed Securities on Fannie Mae’s website,
state that the information about Fannie Mae incorporated by reference into the oﬀering documentation is available at Mortgage-Backed Securities,
explain how to access the oﬀering documentation and the documents incorporated by reference from the website,
state that the oﬀeree has the right to request a printed copy of the oﬀering documentation, and
explain the procedure for requesting a printed copy of the oﬀering documentation.
The Notice of Sale means a notice (including an electronic notice) prepared by the lender to purchasers of securities. The Notice of Sale must:
state that the sale was made pursuant to the oﬀering documentation,
state that the oﬀering documentation is or will be available at Mortgage-Backed Securities,
state that the information about Fannie Mae incorporated by reference into the oﬀering documentation is available at Mortgage-Backed Securities,
explain how to access the oﬀering documentation and the documents incorporated by reference from Mortgage-Backed Securities,
state that the oﬀeree has the right to request a printed copy of the oﬀering documentation, and
Published February 5, 2025
1018
explain the procedure for requesting a printed copy of the oﬀering documentation.
Notwithstanding the Standard Delivery and Alternative Website Delivery options, if the purchaser or oﬀeree of a security requests a hardcopy version of the MBS Prospectus, Prospectus Supplement, or Supplement to the Prospectus Supplement, the lender must honor the request in a timely manner.
The information in the MBS Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement for that security is the only information about a pool (or the mortgage loans included in a pool) that a lender may disclose to the public.
Indemniﬁcation Against Losses
Lenders are subject to all indemniﬁcation obligations as described in A2-1-03, Indemniﬁcation for Losses.

Overview QC Plan Contents Quality Standards and Measures QC File Review Overview Selection of Loans for QC Review Reporting and Remediation
Overview
An eﬀective QC program is a key component of the lender’s overall control environment. The QC program deﬁnes the lender’s standards for loan quality, establishes processes designed to achieve those standards, and mitigates risks associated with the lender’s origination processes. Fannie Mae requires the lender to develop
Published February 5, 2025
1021
and implement a QC program that provides a structure for identifying the deﬁciencies in the loan manufacturing process and for implementing plans to quickly remediate those deﬁciencies and underlying issues. The lender’s QC program must include a documented QC plan that outlines requirements for validating that loans are originated in accordance with its established policies and procedures and
the loans comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations;
the loans comply with the Selling Guide, all related contractual terms and agreements, and are in all respects eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae; and
the QC plan must guard against fraud, negligence, errors, and omissions by oﬃcers, employees, contractors (whether or not involved in the origination of the mortgage loans), brokers, borrowers, marketing partners, appraisers, and others involved in the mortgage process.
Lenders that fail to maintain an eﬀective QC program will be in breach of their contractual obligations with Fannie Mae.
QC Plan Contents
The lender’s QC program must include a documented QC plan that establishes standards for quality and incorporates systems and processes for achieving those standards. The QC plan, at a minimum, must contain the following information.
✓
Lender’s QC Plan Requirements
Quality standards and measures, including:
a general overview of the QC philosophy
plan objectives
speciﬁc risks to be measured, monitored, and managed
methods used to ensure the QC program is an independent and unbiased function including
program governance (targets, sampling) and transaction execution
Procedures: detailed operating and reporting procedures for all employees involved in or
aﬀected by the QC process
QC ﬁle review process: a process for performing prefunding and post-closing QC ﬁle reviews,
including at a minimum, a process for
conﬁrming compliance with Fannie Mae’s Selling Guide, all related contractual terms and
agreements, and that the loans are in all respects eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae
conﬁrming compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations

Lender’s QC Plan Requirements
Sample selection process: a process for identifying a representative sample of loans for QC ﬁle
reviews using both random and discretionary selection processes that includes loans
originated through each applicable production channel (for example, retail, correspondent,
and third-party originators)
originated under all mortgage products (for example, ﬁxed-rate, ARM, and special or niche
programs)
originated using all underwriting methods (manual and each automated underwriting
system)
Reporting: written procedures for reporting the results of the QC ﬁle reviews, including
the method of monthly reporting of review ﬁndings
identifying critical components to be included in the reports
distributing summary-level ﬁndings to senior management
distributing loan-level ﬁndings to the business unit(s), speciﬁcally to parties within the
business unit(s) responsible for resolution
requiring a timely response to, and resolution of (or a plan for resolution of), ﬁndings
identiﬁed in the QC review process
maintaining accurate and detailed records of the results of the lender’s QC reviews
Vendor review: a process for reviewing the QC work performed by the lender’s third-party
vendors
File retention: a process for maintaining for three years records of QC ﬁndings and reports,
loan ﬁles reviewed, and all related documentation, including chronicling the location of such
records
Audit: an audit process to ensure that the lender’s QC processes and procedures are followed
by the QC staﬀ and that its assessments and conclusions are recorded and consistently
applied
Quality Standards and Measures
The lender is responsible for the development and maintenance of standards for loan quality and for the establishment of processes designed to achieve those standards. To evaluate and measure loan quality standards eﬀectively, the lender must establish a methodology for identifying, categorizing, and measuring defects and trends against an established target defect rate.
At a minimum, the lender must identify any loans with a defect (loans not in compliance with the Selling Guide or other related contractual terms and agreements) and establish a methodology by which all loans with identiﬁed defects can be categorized based on the severity of the defect. The lender must deﬁne the severity
Published February 5, 2025
1023
levels appropriate to its organization and reporting needs, however, the highest level of severity must be assigned to those loans with defects resulting in the loan not being eligible as delivered to Fannie Mae.
The lender must also establish target defect rates for its organization, reﬂecting its quality standards and goals. The establishment of a target defect rate is based on the lender’s post-closing random QC sample and enables the lender to regularly evaluate and measure progress in meeting its loan quality standards. Diﬀerent target defect rates may be established for diﬀerent severity levels; however, at a minimum a target defect rate must be established for the lender’s highest level of severity.
A target defect rate must be established that is as reasonably low as possible. Once the targets are set, performance against the targets must be measured at least quarterly and reported to management. The target defect rate(s) must be evaluated and if necessary reset at least annually. The lender must document the rationale for establishing the target rate(s). Fannie Mae may assess how the lender’s chosen target defect rate aﬀects Fannie Mae’s risk and may provide input on a more appropriate target.
QC File Review Overview
As part of its QC program, the lender must establish processes to evaluate and monitor the overall quality of mortgage production through prefunding and post-closing reviews. The purpose of performing a loan ﬁle review is to assess loan quality and eligibility and to conﬁrm that the underwriting decision is well justiﬁed. Loan ﬁle reviews must include, at a minimum, an assessment of
compliance with Fannie Mae requirements by conﬁrming that
the loan meets eligibility and underwriting requirements,
the underwriting decision is adequately supported and all documentation required to support the decision is contained in the ﬁle, and
the loan is secured by a property that provides acceptable collateral; and
compliance with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations. (For additional information, see A3-2-01, Compliance With Laws.)
When the lender’s loan ﬁle review identiﬁes discrepancies between the data and/or information that was used in the underwriting decision and the data or information veriﬁed through the QC process, the lender must reassess the underwriting decision based on the newly veriﬁed information to determine whether the loan remains eligible as delivered to Fannie Mae.
Example: the loan would be considered to be ineligible as delivered in a case when the lender’s review of the settlement statement reveals that the borrower received cash back at closing in an amount that exceeds the limit for limited cash-out reﬁnances, but the loan was underwritten and delivered to Fannie Mae as a limited cash-out reﬁnance.
If the lender determines that the mortgage loan was not eligible as delivered, the lender must advise Fannie Mae of these ﬁndings using the self-report functionality in Loan Quality Connect. For additional information, see D1-3-06, Lender Post-Closing Quality Control Reporting, Record Retention, and Audit and D1-3-03, Lender Post- Closing Quality Control Review of Data Integrity.
Selection of Loans for QC Review
Published February 5, 2025
1024
The lender’s QC process must include mechanisms for monitoring the quality of work performed by employees, contractors, vendors, and other third-parties involved in loan origination, property appraisal, processing, underwriting, appraisal review, and closing functions.
The lender must establish and document a process for identifying a representative sample of loans for QC ﬁle reviews for both prefunding and post-closing QC. While utilizing discretionary ﬁle selections for prefunding QC is appropriate, the post-closing QC process must include both random and discretionary ﬁle selections. The lender must assess and understand the holistic risk inherent in its origination processes when determining the appropriate selection methodology and sample size for its prefunding and post-closing discretionary QC sampling.
When considering elements to target for prefunding or post-closing discretionary reviews, the lender should consider risks inherent in its processes as well as errors or defects identiﬁed through prior reviews. For example, if the lender identiﬁes a particular source of business as high-risk, it may decide to conduct reviews on a sample of those mortgage originations. Similarly, reviews may be used to target a speciﬁc underwriting component (for example, income calculation, asset veriﬁcation) that has exhibited defect trends, or to assess areas that pose unique or elevated risks for the lender or investor, such as loans with delinquencies shortly after origination.
To be eﬀective, the sampling methodology for discretionary review types must be ﬂexible and ﬂuid enough to target loans with higher potential for risk and to be able to adjust as these risks change over time. Prefunding and post-closing discretionary review selection methodologies must be regularly re-evaluated to ensure their eﬀectiveness, and may change frequently as a result of ﬁndings from prior reviews or changes in the lender's product mix, staﬃng, sources of business, or other risk factors.
When the lender sells mortgage loans originated by a third party to Fannie Mae, the lender’s QC process must include additional steps to monitor the quality of third-party originations. At a minimum, the lender’s QC selection process must include a representative sample of the mortgage loans received from the third-party originator to ensure that those originations meet the lender’s standards for loan quality. Review cycles must be structured to ensure that transactions originated by each third-party originator are reviewed at least once annually.
For information on managing third-party originations, see A3-3-01, Outsourcing of Mortgage Processing and Third-Party Originations; for information on prefunding QC review selections, see D1-2-01, Lender Prefunding Quality Control Review Process; and for information on post-closing QC review selections, see D1-3-01, Lender Post-Closing Quality Control Review Process.
Reporting and Remediation
QC reports are a critical component of the QC program. They enable management to evaluate and monitor the quality of the lender’s loan origination process and to identify speciﬁc loans and/or broad based systemic, procedural, or operational issues that need to be addressed or remedied to reduce the lender’s defect rate and improve loan quality. When trends are identiﬁed through the review process, the lender must establish an action plan for speciﬁc corrective action to be taken, including the expected resolution and the time frames for implementation.
The lender must report on the results of both prefunding and post-closing QC ﬁle reviews to senior management on no less than a monthly basis. For information on prefunding reporting requirements, see D1-2-01, Lender Prefunding Quality Control Review Process; for information on post-closing reporting requirements, see D1-3-06, Lender Post-Closing Quality Control Reporting, Record Retention, and Audit.

Requirements for QC Operations Reporting Structure and Staﬃng
To preserve the integrity of the process, all post-closing QC employees (including those related to establishing, monitoring, and enforcing procedures) must be independent of the production, underwriting, and closing departments. If it is not evident that a lender’s organizational structure allows for separation of these functions, the lender’s QC plan must include the rationale for the lack of separation as well as the controls that have been established to mitigate the potential risks associated with the lack of separation of these functions. Additionally, lenders must be able to demonstrate the following in their QC program:
clearly deﬁned testing protocols that are governed by change control and approval authority that support program-level independence, and
documentation at the loan level that supports changes to audit decisions made during the review and rebuttal process.
Lenders must establish minimum requirements for the skill set and expertise of the staﬀ managing and performing the QC ﬁle review process, including the QC vendor oversight, as applicable, by documenting
Published February 5, 2025
1026
minimum job qualiﬁcations. Lenders are responsible for ensuring that all individuals conducting QC reviews are adequately trained and have suﬃcient experience levels relative to the reviews being conducted, including manual underwriting and/or loans processed through any automated underwriting systems utilized by the lender. Lenders are also responsible for ensuring that the reviewers conducting more complex or specialized reviews (for example, appraisals, self-employed borrowers) have the requisite knowledge and experience to do so.
Detailed policies and procedures for the QC ﬁle review process must be provided to all employees who will be involved with the QC ﬁle reviews.
Outsourcing of the QC File Review Process
The lender is responsible for developing and maintaining loan quality standards and developing a QC plan to achieve those standards. Fannie Mae holds the lender fully accountable for its overall QC program and for ensuring that QC loan ﬁle reviews comply with Fannie Mae’s requirements, regardless of whether the work is performed by the lender itself or by an outsourced QC service provider. The lender’s contract for services is not a substitute for the lender establishing and maintaining its own QC plan.
The lender must ensure that the QC vendor conducts its reviews in accordance with the lender’s QC plan. The QC vendor must have written policies and procedures detailing its review methodologies, including selections, identiﬁcation of defects and trends, reveriﬁcations, and reporting those results to the lender. The lender must ensure that the vendor’s review staﬀ possesses the qualiﬁcations and experience required to provide quality reviews and meaningful analysis, and that the vendor’s policies and procedures align with the lender’s QC policies and procedures and meet Fannie Mae’s requirements.
The lender must fully incorporate the results of the vendor’s reviews into its QC reporting and remediation processes. The lender must have procedures to associate the appropriate severity levels to the identiﬁed defects, and to implement corrective actions within the lender’s organization, the same as it would for defects identiﬁed by the lender’s own QC staﬀ.
The lender’s QC plan must include processes for reviewing the vendor’s work to ensure that the lender’s requirements and guidelines are applied consistently and that the review results accurately reﬂect the quality of the lender’s loan originations. The lender must perform a monthly review of a minimum of 10% of the post- closing QC sample reviewed by the vendor to validate the accuracy and completeness of the vendor’s work. The 10% sample must include loans for which the vendor identiﬁed defects and for which no defects were identiﬁed. This review must be performed by the lender itself, and may not be contracted out.
Reports reﬂecting the ﬁnal results of the 10% QC vendor review must be produced on a monthly basis and completed within 30 days following the publication of the ﬁnal QC management report. Although Fannie Mae does not specify an exact format, the reports must be useful to management in evaluating and monitoring the quality of the outsourced QC service provider. The reports, at a minimum, must include
a description of the sample selected for review,
concurrence rates, and
discrepancies identiﬁed by the lender.
The management reports must focus on inaccuracies uncovered in the current month’s review as well as broad trends that are revealed by the vendor QC review process, identifying speciﬁc corrective action that is needed.

Chapter D1-2, Lender Prefunding QC Mortgage Review
Introduction
This chapter explains the requirements for a lender’s prefunding QC review process. It addresses the timing of ﬁle reviews and the process for selecting loans, verifying data and documents, and reporting QC results.
D1-2-01, Lender Prefunding Quality Control Review Process
(10/04/2023)
Introduction This topic contains information on the lender’s prefunding QC process and loan ﬁle reviews, including:
Overview Timing of Loan File Reviews Loan Selection Process Review Types Reporting
Overview
The lender must maintain and implement a written prefunding QC plan that outlines requirements for reviewing a sample of its loans prior to closing or, in the case of loans acquired from a delegated third party, prior to acquisition. The lender must have documented procedures that include, at a minimum, the following elements:
timing of the prefunding QC reviews,
loan selection process,
veriﬁcation of data and documents, and
Published February 5, 2025
1028
reporting.
The lender’s prefunding QC process should operate independent of the lender’s production department, if practical. At a minimum, prefunding QC must be conducted by individuals who have no involvement in the processing and underwriting decision of the loan being reviewed.
The lender’s prefunding QC plan must be designed in a manner that supports its ability to identify and address defects prior to closing a loan. The results of prefunding loan ﬁle reviews provide important and timely feedback to the origination staﬀ, allowing the lender to identify loans with defects (such as analysis or calculation errors, inaccurate data, or inadequate documentation) prior to closing and prevents the lender from delivering ineligible loans to Fannie Mae.
Fannie Mae encourages lenders to implement independent control points throughout the production lifecycle, such as internal and third-party data and analytical tools. Fannie Mae’s own research indicates that these tools can be eﬀective aids in identifying errors and inconsistencies early in the origination process. However, the isolated use of such tools is not a substitute for full ﬁle reviews that are a critical component of a comprehensive prefunding QC process.
Timing of Loan File Reviews
Prefunding QC reviews must be conducted early enough in the origination process to allow adequate time to make loan selections, complete the reviews, and properly inform the loan production organization so that corrections and/or revisions can be made prior to loan closing. Fannie Mae requires reviews to be done when there is suﬃcient documentation in the ﬁle to perform the required review of data and documents described in Review Types, below.
Loan Selection Process
The lender's prefunding QC plan must contain requirements for full reviews of loan ﬁles and analysis of data and documents prior to funding. In addition to the required full ﬁle reviews, the lender may choose to make loan selections designed to focus solely on a speciﬁc element of the loan or underwriting component (for example, income and employment, assets, credit, or property). Component reviews may be completed without performing a full ﬁle QC review. They should be completed in areas the lender believes pose unique or elevated risk, or to conﬁrm that a particular control or process is working as intended. A full ﬁle review is a more comprehensive review of the underwriting decision while a component review is a review of a speciﬁc element.
The lender must establish and document a monthly process for selecting loans for its prefunding QC reviews. The process must take into account the lender’s assessment of the risks inherent in its origination processes, business sources and volume, and product mix, and must be reviewed regularly to ensure that the sample selected is appropriate. The monthly sample must include selections from each of the lender's origination channels.
Lenders must complete a minimum number of prefunding QC reviews monthly. The monthly loan selection must equal, at a minimum, the lesser of:
10% of the prior month's total number of loans originated or acquired, or 750 loans.
Published February 5, 2025
1029
If the lender does not originate or acquire at least 10 loans in the prior month, the lender must select at least one loan for its current month's prefunding QC review.
Note: Government loans acquired from a correspondent lender that meet the following requirements may be excluded from the 10% prefunding sample calculation:
the correspondent lender completed the underwriting of the loan (delegated underwriting); and the correspondent lender obtained the required government guaranty or government insurance, as applicable.
Reviews must target areas that the lender identiﬁes as having a higher potential for errors, misrepresentation, or fraud. Targeted areas may include the following:
loans with characteristics or circumstances related to errors or defects identiﬁed in prior prefunding and post-closing review results;
loans with complex income calculations (for example, rental income, self-employed, and short history of receipt of income);
loans requiring the use of non-standard processing or underwriting guidelines (for example, delayed ﬁnancing, multiple ﬁnanced properties, assets used as income, or manual reserve calculations);
loans secured by properties located in areas with high delinquency rates or areas experiencing rapid increases or decreases in property values;
loans with ﬂags and messages that indicate potential overvaluation or appraisal quality issues on appraisals scored through Collateral Underwriter;
loans with multiple layers of credit risk, such as high LTV ratios, low credit scores, or high DTI ratios;
loans originated or processed through various business sources, a particular branch oﬃce, staﬀ person, contractor, third-party originator, or appraiser;
loans that test the eﬀectiveness of action plan controls;
loans originated or processed by newly hired loan oﬃcers, processors, appraisers, or other personnel or third parties involved in the loan origination process; and
loans for which the feedback or results from third-party tools indicate potential areas of concern.
Review Types
Leveraging a mix of full ﬁle and component reviews can enable lenders to review more loans and provide a broader, more comprehensive risk review than simply performing a full review on all loans sampled.
Full File Reviews
Full ﬁle reviews are comprehensive reviews of an underwriting decision and must include review of, at a minimum, the following data and documents to ensure the documents are present and complete, and that the data relied upon in making the underwriting decision is accurate. A full ﬁle review must include all of the following:
data entered into an automated underwriting system;
Published February 5, 2025
1030
borrower(s)’ Social Security number(s);
income calculations and supporting documentation;
employment documentation, including verbal veriﬁcation of employment;
assets needed to close or meet reserve requirements;
appraisal, if applicable, including reconciliation of CU ﬂags and messages; and
documentation of adequate mortgage insurance coverage.
For loans with income or assets validated by the DU validation service, the lender is not required to re-calculate the validated income or assets as part of its prefunding QC review.
For all loans, including those with validated income, employment, or assets, the lender must continue to ensure the information it enters in DU is appropriate based on its review and investigation of any inconsistent or contradictory information in the loan ﬁle and the veriﬁcation report.
Component Reviews
Component reviews focus on speciﬁc elements of a loan and can be completed more eﬃciently and for less cost than full ﬁle reviews. Targeting high-risk variables can help create visibility into unknown risks and conﬁrm controls are working eﬀectively. Components that can be reviewed include, but are not limited to
income when the DTI ratio is at or over a certain threshold, self-employment income, rental property income or debt, comparable selections, debt properly excluded and documented correctly, student loan payment calculations, solar panel liabilities, and large deposits.
Reporting
Lenders must establish and implement a process to report defects identiﬁed in the prefunding reviews. The process must include
monthly reporting to senior management within 30 days of completion,
communicating to the parties responsible for resolving the defects,
summarizing the results into a report of all prefunding QC ﬁndings, and
documenting the resolution of the defects.
At a minimum, the reports must
describe the sample selection, including the sample criteria, number of loans reviewed, and percentage total of eligible loans reviewed;
Published February 5, 2025
1031
report and trend gross defect percentages for the highest severity level;
include defect trending information for issues and top defects over the most recent three months; and
include action plans to address top defect trends.

Introduction This topic contains information on the lender’s post-closing QC review process and selecting loans for the post- closing QC reviews, including:
Loan File Review Process Timing of QC Review Process Loan Selection Process Random Mortgage Selections and Statistical Sampling Discretionary Mortgage Selections
Published February 5, 2025
1032
Loan File Review Process
The lender’s written QC plan must include processes for evaluating and monitoring the overall quality of the lender’s loan production and its reveriﬁcation procedures.
The post-closing loan ﬁle review process must include a review of the loan to assess the accuracy and integrity of the information used to support the lending decision, the documentation of any defects identiﬁed through the review, and an assessment as to whether or not the loan complies with the Selling Guide, all related contractual terms and agreements, and is in all respects eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae.
At a minimum, the review must include an evaluation of
the accuracy and completeness of the loan application;
the existence and accuracy of the underwriting documents, including reveriﬁcations of underwriting documents, and a data integrity review;
the underwriting decision to conﬁrm it is supported;
the output from any third-party data analysis tools;
the data entered into DU, if applicable;
the appraisal, if applicable;
the property eligibility;
the project eligibility, if applicable;
compliance with the mortgage insurer’s guidelines, and documentation of adequate mortgage insurance coverage;
the existence and accuracy of legal, transaction documentation (for example, sales contract), and closing documentation; and
compliance with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations. (For additional information, see A3-2-01, Compliance With Laws.)
Timing of QC Review Process
Loans must be selected for post-closing QC reviews on at least a monthly basis. The entire QC process (selection, review, rebuttal, and reporting) must be completed within 90 days from the month of the loan closing.
Note: Lenders must notify their Fannie Mae account team or QC Specialist if their QC cycle is in arrears more than one 30-day cycle.
Loan Selection Process
Loans must be selected for post-closing QC reviews on at least a monthly basis. Lenders must select loans through both a random and a discretionary selection process. The lender’s written QC plan must include the following information regarding its loan sampling process:
Published February 5, 2025
1033
the types and frequency of selections, and
a deﬁned process for selecting loans for QC review.
See D1-1-01, Lender Quality Control Programs, Plans, and Processes, for additional information.
Random Mortgage Selections and Statistical Sampling
The lender must select for its post-closing QC review a minimum of 10% of the loans that it originates or acquires from a third party using a random selection methodology (unless a statistical sampling methodology is used). If 10% is less than one loan, then at least one loan must be selected. The loans selected must be representative of the lender’s overall book of business, including
all of the diﬀerent types of loans that the lender oﬀers,
loans originated by each branch oﬃce and by third-party originators, and
manually underwritten loans as well as loans that were processed through automated underwriting system(s) utilized by the lender.
If the lender uses statistical sampling for its selection process, at a minimum, the statistical sampling model (variables) must be calculated using a 95% conﬁdence level with a 2% precision rate and a statistical statement of six months. (Fannie Mae recommends using a three month statement.) The lender must document the methodology and provide, upon request, a detailed written justiﬁcation of the methodology, including the following information:
method for making a statistical selection;
variables used in the selection model and how they are deﬁned (for example, population size, precision rate, percentage of defect rate, and conﬁdence level); and
the results of periodic evaluations of the process and variables, and establishment of time periods for the evaluations.
Fannie Mae may require adjustments to the statistical methodology based upon its review.
Discretionary Mortgage Selections
Discretionary QC samples are a required element for post-closing QC plans. These selections supplement (but do not replace) a lender's random (or statistical) sample. The purpose of a discretionary sample is to look for or highlight areas that may pose unique or elevated levels of risk for the lender or to conﬁrm that a particular control or process is working as intended.
The lender must establish a process for selecting loans for its discretionary post-closing QC selections. The process must take into account the lender’s assessment of the risks inherent in its origination processes, business sources and volume, and product mix, and must be reviewed regularly and, when necessary, adjusted to ensure that the sample selected, including sample size, is appropriate.
Loans selected for post-closing discretionary QC reviews must target areas that the lender identiﬁes as having a higher potential for errors, misrepresentation, or fraud. Targeted areas may include the following:
Published February 5, 2025
1034
loans with characteristics related to errors or defects identiﬁed in prior prefunding and post-closing review results;
loans with complex income calculations (for example, rental income, self-employed, short history of receipt of income);
loans requiring the use of non-standard processing or underwriting guidelines (for example, delayed ﬁnancing, multiple ﬁnanced properties, assets used as income, or manual reserve calculations);
loans secured by properties located in areas with high delinquency rates or areas experiencing rapid increases or decreases in property values;
loans with multiple layers of credit risk, such as high LTV ratios, low credit scores, or high DTI ratios;
loans originated or processed through various business sources, a particular branch oﬃce, staﬀ person, contractor, third-party originator, or appraiser;
loans originated or processed by newly hired loan oﬃcers, processors, appraisers, or other personnel or third parties involved in the loan origination process;
loans that may be subject to concerns about delinquency rates or patterns identiﬁed in other reviews; and
loans for which the feedback or results from third-party tools indicates potential areas of concern.
Note: Fannie Mae requires the lender to sample loans that have a high risk for fraud as part of its QC process. This includes loans that are early payment defaults. (See A3-4-03, Preventing, Detecting, and Reporting Mortgage Fraud.)

D1-3-02, Lender Post-Closing Quality Control Review of Approval
Conditions, Underwriting Decisions, and Documentation
(08/07/2024)
Introduction This topic contains information on the lender’s post-closing QC review of underwriting documents, including:
Overview Review of Underwriting Decision and Approval Conditions Review of DU Findings and Conditions General Requirements for Reveriﬁcations Use of IRS Request for Transcript of Tax Return Form 4506-C in the Lender's QC Plan Reveriﬁcation of Borrower’s Income and Employment Information Reveriﬁcation of Borrower’s Asset Information Income, Employment, or Assets Validated by the DU Validation Service Reveriﬁcation of Borrower’s Credit History Veriﬁcation of Owner-Occupancy
Overview
The lender must verify the accuracy and integrity of the information used to support the lending decision for any mortgage loans selected for a QC review. All reveriﬁcation documentation must be retained either in the underwriting ﬁle or in the lender’s QC records. The lender’s QC plan must document where the reveriﬁcations will be maintained.
When the reveriﬁcations are performed by an outsource vendor, it is acceptable for the reveriﬁcation documentation to be maintained with the vendor rather than in the underwriting or QC ﬁles. In such cases, the vendor must provide the lender with the results of the reveriﬁcation ﬁndings, which must be accessible to the lender along with the reveriﬁcation documentation for at least three years from the date of the review and must be provided to Fannie Mae upon request.
When information obtained through the reveriﬁcation process diﬀers from the information utilized in the underwriting of the loan, the lender must re-underwrite the loan to verify that the loan remains eligible as delivered to Fannie Mae.
Review of Underwriting Decision and Approval Conditions
The lender must conﬁrm that the mortgage loan was underwritten in accordance with Fannie Mae’s requirements and that adequate support for the underwriting decision is contained in the loan ﬁle.
The lender must conﬁrm that all loan approval conditions required by the underwriter were satisﬁed and that the information on the closing documents, including the settlement statement, is consistent with the underwriting decision and the ﬁnal terms of the mortgage loan.
Published February 5, 2025
1036
Review of DU Findings and Conditions
For loans underwritten through DU, the lender must conﬁrm that all DU Veriﬁcation Messages/Approval Conditions that appear in the DU Underwriting Findings report were satisfactorily resolved and adequately supported by appropriate documentation. If DU returned an Ineligible recommendation, the reviewer must conﬁrm that the loan was eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae.
For additional information on circumstances under which an Ineligible recommendation may be acceptable, see B3-2, Desktop Underwriter (DU).
General Requirements for Reveriﬁcations
When conducting the required post-closing QC reviews on loans selected through the random selection process, the reveriﬁcations or reviews noted below must be performed for all selected loans.
As part of its discretionary loan selection process, the lender may choose to make targeted loan selections designed to focus solely on a speciﬁc element of the loan, such as product, business source, or underwriting component (for example, income and employment, assets, credit, or property).
When conducting the required discretionary post-closing QC reviews, the lender must consider the purpose of the targeted selection when determining whether certain reveriﬁcations are necessary. For example, if the purpose of the targeted selection is to focus speciﬁcally on income calculations, reveriﬁcation of assets or a review of the appraisal is not within the scope of the review and is not required to be completed; however, reveriﬁcations of income and employment are required. If the purpose of the targeted selection is to review loans originated through a new source of business, then all areas of the loan are in the scope of the review and all reveriﬁcations noted below must be performed. The lender must assess the purpose of the targeted loan selection and conduct the reveriﬁcations or reviews noted below as appropriate.
Use of IRS Request for Transcript of Tax Return Form 4506-C in the Lender's QC Plan
Fannie Mae requires lenders to include the requirement to submit the IRS Form 4506-C to the IRS (or designee) in their written QC plan. An alternative form or process is also acceptable if it authorizes the release of comparable tax information from the IRS.
For all loans reviewed through the random selection process (and for loans selected through the discretionary selection process, as applicable), the post-closing QC review must include the lender's submission for tax transcripts to the IRS (or designee) using the IRS Form 4506-C or an acceptable alternative IRS form or process.
Transcripts must be obtained for all income types used in the underwriting process (personal and business, if applicable). If tax returns were required in the underwriting of the loan, the lender must obtain transcripts for the same tax years as documented by the borrower’s tax returns. The lender must reconcile the transcript information received from the IRS with the income documents in the loan ﬁle. See B3-3.1-06, Requirements and Uses of IRS IVES Request for Transcript of Tax Return Form 4506-C, for detailed information.
The following exceptions apply:
Published February 5, 2025
1037
Lenders that obtain the appropriate IRS transcripts during their pre-closing process (processing and underwriting) may use the same documents in their post-closing QC process without ordering new transcripts.
Lenders are not required to obtain tax transcripts for a borrower when all of that borrower’s income was validated by the DU validation service.
Reveriﬁcation of Borrower’s Income and Employment Information
For all loans selected via the random selection process (and for loans selected through the discretionary selection process, as applicable) the post-closing QC review must include reveriﬁcation of the borrower’s income and employment information.
The lender must reverify the borrower’s income and employment information directly with the source of the original documentation and pay any applicable fees the employer may charge to provide the reveriﬁcation information. The reveriﬁcation should be in writing; however, a verbal reveriﬁcation is acceptable provided the lender documents the conversation in writing, stating the name, title or position, and contact information of the interviewee. The reveriﬁcation documentation must be maintained in the underwriting ﬁle. If the employer does not provide veriﬁcation of a borrower’s income, the loan ﬁle must be documented to state the date the information was requested, but that it was not obtained. Reveriﬁcation procedures may be supplemented with alternative information sources available on the Internet, maintained by state or local licensing authorities, and other third parties.

1039
Reveriﬁcation of Borrower’s Asset Information
For all loans selected via the random selection process (and for loans selected through the discretionary selection process, as applicable) the post-closing QC review must include reveriﬁcation of the borrower’s asset information. The lender must reverify all sources of funds used for down payment, closing costs, and any required reserves directly with the source of the original documentation (such as, ﬁnancial institutions and gift donors).
Fannie Mae requires that the lender attempt to reverify the borrower’s assets (and pay any applicable fees for the reveriﬁcation) and reconcile the information from the ﬁnancial institution with information in the underwriting ﬁle. Fannie Mae recognizes that reveriﬁcation of asset information directly from the borrower’s ﬁnancial institution may not be possible in all instances. If the reveriﬁcation of asset information cannot be obtained from the ﬁnancial institution, the lender must document its attempt in its QC records.
When a third-party asset veriﬁcation report is provided to DU for an assessment of rent payment history or a cash ﬂow assessment, reveriﬁcation of the full 12 months of asset data is not required. Reveriﬁcation of the assets used speciﬁcally for veriﬁcation of assets is required as described above.
Income, Employment, or Assets Validated by the DU Validation Service
The borrower’s income, employment, or assets do not have to be reveriﬁed (or recalculated) if they were validated by the DU Validation Service, and
the lender satisﬁed all the requirements for obtaining representation and warranty enforcement relief (as described in A2-2-04, Limited Waiver and Enforcement Relief of Representations and Warranties), and
the loan closed by the "Close by Date" stated in the DU validation message.
Reveriﬁcation of Borrower’s Credit History
For all loans selected via the random selection process (and for loans selected through the discretionary selection process, as applicable) the post-closing QC review must include reveriﬁcation of the borrower’s credit history.
If a borrower’s credit was evaluated by using a traditional credit report, the lender must reverify the borrower’s credit history by obtaining a new tri-merge credit report. The new report does not need to generate a new inquiry that will appear on future credit reports or include trended credit data even if reﬂected on the credit report used for underwriting purposes. Lenders are not required to analyze trended credit data in the new credit report.
If a borrower’s credit history was evaluated by using nontraditional credit or a nontraditional mortgage credit report, the lender must reverify each of the credit references on that report. If the lender obtained written references from creditors, the lender’s QC review process must include reveriﬁcation of each of the credit references.
The liability information obtained on the new credit report must be reconciled against the credit report or references used at the time of underwriting the loan to identify any discrepancies or the existence of any debt
Published February 5, 2025

that may not have been taken into account when the loan was underwritten. The lender must also review any “potential red ﬂag” messages appearing in the DU Underwriting Findings report or alerts created by sources other than DU associated with the credit report to ensure all messages have been addressed and documented, and that the loan is eligible for sale to Fannie Mae.
Veriﬁcation of Owner-Occupancy
For all loans secured by a principal residence that are selected via the random selection process (and for loans selected through the discretionary selection process, as applicable) the post-closing QC review must include veriﬁcation of owner-occupancy. The lender must review the property insurance policy and other documentation in the ﬁle (for example, appraisal, income tax returns or transcripts) to conﬁrm that there are no indicators that the property is not the borrower’s principal residence.

Veriﬁcation of Data Integrity
The lender must review the ﬁnal terms of the loan to ensure they align with data on which the underwriting was based. When a lender’s loan ﬁle review identiﬁes discrepancies between the data that was used in the underwriting decision and the data veriﬁed through the QC process, the lender must reassess the underwriting decision based on the newly veriﬁed information to determine whether the loan remains eligible as delivered to Fannie Mae.
For mortgages processed through DU, the lender must ensure that all data submitted to DU is true, correct, and complete. The lender must verify that the loan ﬁle contains documentation that supports all data submitted to DU to process the mortgage loan. The lender must ensure that all of the borrower’s liabilities were included in DU’s analysis.
When there are inconsistencies between the data and/or information submitted to DU (or used for manual underwriting) and the source documents, the lender must

For loans underwritten through DU, if discrepancies are outside the DU allowed tolerances,
resubmit the mortgage loan to DU using the correct data. If the lender is unable to resubmit
the loan to DU, the lender must manually perform a comprehensive risk assessment using
the documentation required by DU, to determine if the loan meets the Selling Guide

Introduction This topic contains information on the lender's post-closing QC review of appraisers, appraisals, property data collectors, and property data collection including:
Overview Oversight of Appraisers and Data Collectors Veriﬁcation of Origination Appraisals Veriﬁcation of Property Data Collection Reporting
Overview
The lender must continually evaluate the quality of its appraisals and property data collection through the normal underwriting review of all appraisal reports and property data collection, and by utilizing prudent collateral risk assessment processes as part of the QC process. The lender should also utilize third-party tools and information (such as analytical tools and public record databases) to help identify areas of inaccuracy or inconsistencies that may be indicators of appraisal deﬁciencies.
Oversight of Appraisers and Data Collectors
The lender’s QC plan must include requirements for monitoring and assessing the overall quality of work performed by an appraiser and property data collector, including a process for loan-level QC reviews of origination appraisals and property data collection. Fannie Mae holds the lender fully accountable for the quality of the QC appraisal and property data collection reviews regardless of whether the work is performed by the lender itself or by an outsourced QC service provider.
The lender must also develop and maintain a documented process to monitor the appraisers and property data collectors it uses.
For appraisers, the process (at a minimum) must include an annual review of an appraiser’s state licensing or certiﬁcation status and a procedure for suspending or terminating business with individual appraisers. Additionally, the lender must have a procedure for referring appraisers to the applicable state appraiser licensing and regulatory board. For property data collectors, lenders must (at a minimum) ensure annual background checks and evidence the data collector has successfully received professional training for property data collection and fair lending law compliance. Lenders must also have a procedure for suspending or terminating business with individual property data collectors.
See B4-1.3-12, Appraisal Quality Matters, for information concerning Fannie Mae’s right to refuse to accept appraisals prepared by speciﬁc appraisers.
Published February 5, 2025
1044
Veriﬁcation of Origination Appraisals
The lender must complete a collateral risk assessment for all mortgage loans with an appraisal as a part of its random QC sample. It is acceptable for the collateral risk assessment to be completed by an individual who is not a licensed or certiﬁed appraiser. However, the collateral risk assessor must be competent in appraisal theory and must be able to speciﬁcally:
determine that a property meets eligibility requirements including the LTV, CLTV, and HCLTV ratios;
assess appropriateness of comparable sales;
assess appropriateness of the data presented and verify the appraisal report complies with B4-1.1-04, Unacceptable Appraisal Practices;
conclude that the rationale for the reconciliation of value is supported;
prescribe corrective actions for defects identiﬁed in the appraisal process; and
reconcile ﬂags and messages that were identiﬁed in Collateral Underwriter (CU) if the property was able to be scored in CU. If the property was not able to be scored in CU then reconcile any known quality messages (messages, alerts, ﬂags) that are reﬂected in other third-party tools if utilized.
If the lender is unable to complete the above assessment or appropriately determine the quality of the origination appraisal, it may order either a desk review or ﬁeld review from a licensed appraiser. The desk review or ﬁeld review must account for all of the points in the above requirements.
Veriﬁcation of Property Data Collection
The lender must complete a collateral risk assessment for all mortgage loans with a property data collection as a part of its random QC sample. The collateral risk assessor must be competent in assessing property eligibility and characteristics including condition and quality, and must be able to speciﬁcally
assess the accuracy of the data obtained through the property data collection; identify any property eligibility issues and items of safety, soundness, or structural integrity; determine whether the lender appropriately required repairs or inspections; and prescribe corrective actions for defects identiﬁed in the quality control process.
Reporting
For appraisals, the lender must determine whether any defects identiﬁed through its collateral risk assessment process results in the value not being supported or the loan being ineligible. For property data collection, the lender must determine whether any defects result in the property not being in acceptable condition or the property being ineligible. If the lender determines that the mortgage loan was not eligible as delivered, the lender must advise Fannie Mae of these ﬁndings using the self-report functionality in Loan Quality Connect. For additional information, see D1-3-06, Lender Post-Closing Quality Control Reporting, Record Retention, and Audit.
Examples
Appraisal: The lender sells a two-unit property loan to Fannie Mae and, after reviewing the appraisal, the
Published February 5, 2025
1045
lender determines that the property is a mixed-use property. Because mixed-use properties are limited to one-unit, the loan is ineligible as sold to Fannie Mae and the lender must self-report the loan. Property data collection: The lender sells a one unit property loan to Fannie Mae and, after reviewing the property data collection, determines the property was a two-unit property. Because property data collection is limited to one-unit dwellings, the loan is ineligible as sold to Fannie Mae and the lender must self-report the loan. Property data collection: The lender sells a value acceptance + property data loan to Fannie Mae and, after reviewing photos of the property, determines the roof needs repair. Because roof repairs constitute a soundness or structural integrity issue, the loan is ineligible as sold to Fannie Mae and the lender must self-report the loan.
In both of these property data collection examples, the lender should have a feedback loop to ensure that underwriting teams learn how to properly manage such issues. In the ﬁrst example, the lender should have switched to a traditional appraisal on the two- to four-unit form, and in the second example, the lender should have required roof repairs prior to loan closing.

Review of Transaction and Closing Documents
The lender must review each transaction and closing document for completeness, accuracy, and compliance with all underwriting and eligibility requirements, and to ensure adherence to the loan transaction. The following list reﬂects the most common documents that must be included in the post-closing document review. The list is not intended to be all-inclusive, and lenders must exercise judgment when determining other documents to include in the review process.
Uniform Residential Loan Application (Form 1003)
Signed sales contract and any applicable addenda
Recorded security instrument and any applicable riders or addenda
Mortgage loan note
Assignment of the mortgage loan
Mortgage insurance certiﬁcate or policy
VA loan guaranty certiﬁcate, RD loan note guarantee, FHA mortgage insurance certiﬁcate, or HUD Indian loan guarantee certiﬁcate, as applicable
Title evidence
Plat or survey, as applicable
Final Truth in Lending disclosure, as applicable
Settlement statement
Evidence of property and, if applicable, ﬂood insurance
Other closing documents, as applicable
Note: If recorded documents are not available when the post-closing QC review is performed due to timing requirements for the reviews and the length of time the jurisdictions need for recording, the lender should review a copy of the document sent for recordation. The lender must also have a process to review the recorded documents when received to ensure their accuracy, and remediate any errors.
If errors are discovered in the post-closing review process, lenders must
determine the signiﬁcance of the errors;
promptly correct the document(s) or obtain corrected document(s) from the vendor (for example, mortgage or property insurer or title company); and
provide corrected documents to the document custodian, if applicable.

Introduction This topic contains information about the post-closing QC process pertaining to the following:
Lender’s Internal QC Reporting Lender’s Responsibilities for Self-Reporting to Fannie Mae Record Retention and Response to Fannie Mae Requests Audit Review of the QC Process
Lender’s Internal QC Reporting
Although Fannie Mae does not specify an exact format for reports, the lender must design reports that are useful to management for evaluating and monitoring the quality of the lender’s mortgage loan production. The management reports must cover QC results at a high level by focusing on defects and broad trends that are revealed by the review process, as well as identifying mortgage loans or items that need speciﬁc corrective action.
Reporting needs are unique to each lender; however, at a minimum, post-closing QC reports must be produced monthly and
reﬂect the ﬁnal defect rate for the results of the current review period (taking into account responses and resolution of the initial QC ﬁndings);
include trending information (issues and top defects);
distinguish between defects related to compliance with federal, state, or local laws and regulations and underwriting and eligibility defects;
report on each type of review (random and discretionary) and provide results using consistent methodology and terminology across review types;
include intended corrective actions; and
summarize the results of each individual review type into a comprehensive, summary report of all QC ﬁndings.
Lender’s Responsibilities for Self-Reporting to Fannie Mae
The lender must notify Fannie Mae within 30 days of conﬁrmation that one or more defects identiﬁed through the QC ﬁle review process results in the loan being ineligible as delivered to Fannie Mae. Notiﬁcation must be made using the self-report functionality in Loan Quality Connect.
When making the self-report to Fannie Mae, the lender must provide Fannie Mae with a report of its ﬁndings and copies of the relevant documentation that support the reason for the ﬁnding. For example, if tax return
Published February 5, 2025
1048
transcripts reveal that qualifying income was inaccurate such that the borrower was not qualiﬁed for the loan on the terms and pricing oﬀered, the lender should provide copies of the original income documentation and the tax return transcripts with its notiﬁcation to Fannie Mae.
For information on the lender’s responsibility to self-report any misrepresentation, fraud, or other possible breach of a selling warranty or compliance with laws, see A2-2-01, Representations and Warranties Overview, A3-2-01, Compliance With Laws, and A3-4-03, Preventing, Detecting, and Reporting Mortgage Fraud.
Record Retention and Response to Fannie Mae Requests
The lender must retain all written and electronic records that are created as part of a QC review process for a minimum of three years. These records include documentation of QC reports, QC review ﬁndings, successful rebuttal documentation, as well as documentation related to any corrective actions. The lenders must provide Fannie Mae with a copy of its records upon request.
Audit Review of the QC Process
The lender must have an independent audit process to ensure that its QC process and procedures are followed by the QC staﬀ, and that assessments and conclusions are recorded and consistently applied. The ﬁndings must be accurately recorded and consistent with the defects noted in the lender’s system of record.
Results of the QC audit must be distributed to senior management. It must include an aﬃrmative statement that no inﬂuence from other business units or bias in the QC conclusions was apparent. Management must distribute the results to the appropriate areas within the organization and an action plan must be established for remediation or changes to policies or processes, if appropriate. The lender must provide a copy of the QC audits and the audit of the QC process to Fannie Mae upon request.

Mae to ensure that they meet its underwriting and eligibility requirements. This subpart describes Fannie Mae’s policies and practices with respect to the selection, review, and reporting of results; and the lender’s responsibilities for participating in this process. Fannie Mae also reviews servicing ﬁles with the primary focus of conﬁrming that the mortgage loan has been serviced in accordance with the and Lender Contract. See the for a description of the servicing QC process. In addition, within the Loan Quality Center, the Data Validation Center team follows up on loan-level data discrepancies to perform required data changes that, in some instances, may indicate eligibility concerns leading to a full underwriting review.

(04/03/2019)
Introduction This topic contains general information on Fannie Mae's QC reviews, including:
Fannie Mae’s QC Policy Fannie Mae QC Reports
Fannie Mae’s QC Policy
Fannie Mae has QC policies and procedures in place for its review of performing and non-performing mortgage loans. Fannie Mae uses a statistically valid approach in selecting a random sample of new mortgage loan deliveries for review. The random sample is augmented with targeted, discretionary sampling, which aids in the measurement of the overall quality of loan deliveries. The QC process evaluates loan ﬁles on a comprehensive basis with the primary focus of conﬁrming that mortgage loans meet Fannie Mae’s underwriting and eligibility requirements. The satisfactory conclusion of QC reviews may also result in mortgage loans being eligible for relief from enforcement for breaches of certain representations and warranties. See A2-3.2-02, Enforcement Relief for Breaches of Certain Representations and Warranties Related to Underwriting and Eligibility, for additional information.
The QC process also provides lenders with data and feedback about the quality of their loan origination process. The goal is to engage lenders in frequent, meaningful exchanges of information about trends in the quality of delivered loans and to inform lenders about signiﬁcant underwriting deﬁciencies identiﬁed through the review
Published February 5, 2025
1050
process. Together, Fannie Mae and its lenders should share a commitment to improving the quality of loan originations.
Fannie Mae’s QC policies are administered by its Loan Quality Center. The selection process may change at any time to address risk concerns.
As a component of overall loan quality, the Data Validation Center team reviews loan data exceptions that are identiﬁed after Fannie Mae acquires the loan. This includes and data exceptions that may be found through reviews. The Data Validation Center works with lenders to research data exceptions and submit related data corrections. In some instances, the data change review may lead to a full underwriting review if eligibility concerns are identiﬁed or the data exception cannot be resolved. See C1-2-01, General Information on Delivering Loan Data and Documents, for additional information.
Fannie Mae QC Reports
Fannie Mae provides lenders with ongoing feedback about their overall QC performance. The feedback identiﬁes defect types, reporting on frequent or common defects, and describes quality trend analyses and signiﬁcant underwriting deﬁciencies identiﬁed through the QC loan ﬁle review process. This information is provided through a variety of methods that range from regular electronic transmissions to more formal periodic discussions.
The detailed loan-level reports that lenders receive identify signiﬁcant defects, ﬁndings, and loans with no identiﬁed defects.
Fannie Mae’s quality control process provides lenders with a holistic view of loan quality by identifying loans with signiﬁcant defects as well as loans that had ﬁndings that do not aﬀect the overall eligibility. Fannie Mae believes that providing this additional feedback supplies lenders with an important source of information that can lead to improving loan quality in the future. At times this reporting may contain nonpublic personal information (NPI). Fannie Mae shares this NPI with lenders in compliance with permitted purposes under applicable privacy laws. See A3-4-01, Conﬁdentiality of Information, for additional information.

(03/06/2024)
Introduction This topic contains information on Fannie Mae QC requests for loan ﬁles, including:
Notiﬁcation of a QC Review Document Submission Requirements Loan File Delivery Timeline
Notiﬁcation of a QC Review
Lenders are notiﬁed which loans Fannie Mae has selected for QC review via an email sent by Fannie Mae’s Loan Quality Connect. Therefore, lenders are required to register for Loan Quality Connect to obtain access to it.
Document Submission Requirements
Lenders must maintain a complete loan ﬁle, including all documents used to support the underwriting decision. Upon Fannie Mae’s request, lenders must provide electronic copies of the complete loan ﬁle, as described in the request.
When a third-party asset veriﬁcation report is provided to DU for an assessment of rent payment history or a cash ﬂow assessment, an asset veriﬁcation report covering the minimum period of time described in A2-4.1-01, Establishing Loan Files, is required to be maintained in the loan ﬁle and provided upon request.
When income or employment are validated by the DU validation service using an asset veriﬁcation report, the asset report covering the period of time that is required to be retained in the loan ﬁle (that is, 30- or 60- days) must be provided upon request. The lender will be required to provide the full asset veriﬁcation report containing the entirety of the data provided to DU only if requested by Fannie Mae.
Loan ﬁles or documents can be uploaded using the drag-and-drop feature or by uploading to the corresponding task in Loan Quality Connect. Lenders should contact the Loan Quality Center for assistance in determining which electronic option best aligns with their business needs and operations, and to initiate the on-boarding process, if they have not already done so. See the following resources for additional information:
Bulk Upload of Loan Files or Documents
E-1-02, List of Contacts, for the Digital Data Control Team - LQC; and
Loan Quality Connect.
Loan ﬁles must include clear, complete “copies” of any required documents. Lenders should remove all duplicate documents before sending in the ﬁle. The requested ﬁles must include the applicable documentation listed in the Post-Closing Loan File Document Checklist (Form 1032). For information concerning the required contents of a loan ﬁle, see A2-4.1-02, Ownership and Retention of Loan Files and Records. (Completion and submission of Form 1032 is optional.) Lenders must follow the electronic submission naming protocol to associate the Fannie Mae loan number with the electronic ﬁle.
Published February 5, 2025
1052
Lenders that are unable to submit loan ﬁles in the supported format should contact the Loan Quality Center to determine if an alternate format may be used as an interim submission method. To avoid non-compliant loan ﬁles, lenders should not submit loan ﬁles using an alternate method without approval from the Loan Quality Center to ensure that Fannie Mae can access and review the loan ﬁle documentation and that the lender receives credit for the loan ﬁle submission. Loan ﬁles submitted using an alternate method (for example, paper ﬁles) without prior approval from the Loan Quality Center may not be accepted.
Loan File Delivery Timeline
Lenders must send the requested documentation for an underwriting, servicing, or data validation review within 30 days after Fannie Mae notiﬁes the lender that it has selected a loan for review. Fannie Mae, in its sole discretion, may request the documentation in a shorter or longer period of time based upon circumstances at the time.
Fannie Mae will make every eﬀort to work with lenders when extenuating circumstances prevent them from delivering documentation in a timely manner. However, if a lender delays in providing the requested information, Fannie Mae, in its sole discretion, may require indemniﬁcation or repurchase (depending on the circumstances of the individual case) of these loans. When a lender has a pattern of extensive delays or unresponsiveness, Fannie Mae may consider this a breach of contract and consider other actions against the lender, up to and including termination.

Introduction This topic describes the possible outcomes of Fannie Mae QC reviews, including:
Deﬁnition of Origination Defects Under the Remedies Framework Criteria for Determining Signiﬁcant Defects Under the Remedies Framework Breach of Mortgage Insurance Policy
Deﬁnition of Origination Defects Under the Remedies Framework
Upon completion of a full-ﬁle quality control review for loans covered by the remedies framework, Fannie Mae will designate any defect uncovered during that review as one of the following:
A “ﬁnding” is one or more defects that, when considered with other loan features, does not necessitate a change in the price of the loan or result in the loan being unacceptable even if the true and accurate facts about the loan had been known at the time Fannie Mae purchased or securitized the loan.
A “price-adjusted loan (PAL)” has one or more defects that, when considered with other loan features and based on the facts of the loan as purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae, result in a loan that was otherwise eligible for delivery had the correct data been delivered and LLPA been paid to Fannie Mae by the lender.
A “signiﬁcant defect” is one or more defects that either necessitates a change to the price on which the loan was acquired or result in the loan being unacceptable for purchase had the true and accurate information about the loan been known at time of purchase. Loans with ﬁndings and PALS are not loans with signiﬁcant defects.
See A2-3.2-03, Remedies Framework, for additional information about the remedies framework.
Criteria for Determining Signiﬁcant Defects Under the Remedies Framework
In determining whether there is a signiﬁcant defect on a loan covered by the remedies framework, Fannie Mae must give due consideration to the severity of the defect. In addition, the defect must relate to one of the following:

D2-1-04, Identifying and Remedying Origination Defects Under the
Remedies Framework (08/30/2016)
Introduction This topic describes the process that Fannie Mae will follow to identify defects and allow corrections and remedies for loans covered by the remedies framework, including:
Deﬁnitions of Remedy and Correction Overview of Process
Deﬁnitions of Remedy and Correction
The actions that constitute a remedy or a correction for loans covered by the remedies framework are described below.
A “remedy” is an action elected by Fannie Mae to resolve a signiﬁcant defect pursuant to the Lender Contract in eﬀect at the time of loan purchase. (See A2-3.2-03, Remedies Framework, for additional information.)
A “correction” is an action taken by a lender (typically through delivery of documentation or information to Fannie Mae) that demonstrates that a signiﬁcant defect
Published February 5, 2025
1056
did not, in fact, exist at the time of loan purchase or securitization; or
has been corrected in the time frame and manner speciﬁed in the Lender Contract such that the defect is no longer considered by Fannie Mae to be a signiﬁcant defect.
One example of a correction is a “de minimis correction,” which is a minor amount not to exceed $500 (or such higher amount as the lender and Fannie Mae may agree) that, when remitted, refunded, or otherwise provided, corrects or otherwise resolves an identiﬁed signiﬁcant defect. However, a “de minimis correction” cannot be made
when the correction would result in a speciﬁc required minimum borrower contribution not being met, or
to correct a violation of Fannie Mae’s Charter requirements.
Another example of a correction is the acquisition of required insurance.
Overview of Process
The steps that Fannie Mae and lenders will follow for mortgage loans covered by the remedies framework to identify, correct, appeal, and remedy defects are described below.
Step 1—Identiﬁcation of Findings, PALs, and Signiﬁcant Defects
After a full-ﬁle quality control review is completed, Fannie Mae will designate any defect(s) as a ﬁnding, a PAL, or a signiﬁcant defect. As a reminder, the scope of the full-ﬁle quality control review remains the same for performing loans and non-performing loans.
Note: Fannie Mae also checks mortgage loans for data discrepancies (which could be independent of a full-ﬁle quality control review) that may result in the assessment of an LLPA.
If Fannie Mae designates a defect as a ﬁnding, a correction or remedy will not be required. However, a data update may be required.
If Fannie Mae designates a defect as resulting in a PAL, the lender must pay the applicable LLPA that should have been paid when the mortgage loan was purchased by Fannie Mae had the true and accurate facts about the mortgage loan been known at the time of purchase.
Fannie Mae may not demand repurchase of a PAL and the lender may not voluntarily repurchase a PAL.
If Fannie Mae identiﬁes a signiﬁcant defect, Fannie Mae will require repurchase of the mortgage loan or may oﬀer the lender a repurchase alternative.
Step 2—Correcting Certain Signiﬁcant Defects
During the appeal and impasse processes, a lender has the right to provide a correction of any signiﬁcant defect in the speciﬁed time frame and in the manner required by the Lender Contract. Any additional documentation or information that the lender provides is subject to the same standard of quality control review as the initial mortgage ﬁle documentation.
In the event that the Lender Contract does not specify the time frame and manner required for the correction of
Published February 5, 2025
1057
a particular signiﬁcant defect, Fannie Mae shall determine if the signiﬁcant defect has been corrected. There may be times when the determination of whether or not a defect has been corrected cannot be determined by Fannie Mae, but rather needs to be determined by the purchaser of an acquired property, its title insurer or the investor of the purchaser’s mortgage loan. For example, the determination of whether there has been a correction of a certain title defect may hinge on whether the purchaser of the acquired property is willing to pay full market value for the subject property, given the title defect and the steps taken to attempt to correct the title defect.
The documentation submitted to correct a signiﬁcant defect must be based on information or data that either:
was available at the time of underwriting (and no later than the note date ), or
covers the time of underwriting so long as such evidence meets the applicable documentation requirements set forth in the Lender Contract.
Note: Lenders have the ability to correct defects during the appeal and impasse processes related to property, ﬂood, or mortgage insurance.
If the lender does not repurchase the loan or perform any repurchase alternative in accordance with the Lender Contract, the lender continues to have the obligation to correct any signiﬁcant defect in accordance with the Lender Contract.
Step 3—Fannie Mae Review of Lender Response and Mortgage Loan Reassessment
During the appeal and impasse processes, Fannie Mae will conduct a mortgage loan reassessment by reviewing any corrections submitted by the lender in accordance with the applicable Lender Contract in order to determine whether a signiﬁcant defect still exists.
If, following the reassessment, Fannie Mae determines that
the lender submitted documentation and/or information or took all necessary steps to correct all signiﬁcant defects in accordance with the Lender Contract, Fannie Mae will rescind or close out, as applicable, the demand.
the lender corrected some, but not all, of the signiﬁcant defects that had been identiﬁed on a mortgage loan, Fannie Mae will reaﬃrm the demand and the lender must comply with the demand on a timely basis.
all signiﬁcant defects were corrected but any remaining defects now cause the mortgage loan to be a PAL, or the loan is now determined to be a PAL, the lender must pay Fannie Mae the LLPA that should have been paid when the mortgage loan was purchased by Fannie Mae had the true and accurate facts about the mortgage loan been known at the time of purchase.
it cannot determine if all signiﬁcant defects were corrected because the decision is up to the purchaser of the acquired property, Fannie Mae may defer its determination until the subject property has been placed on the market in order to obtain feedback on the marketability of the title of the subject property.
At any time during the appeals process, a lender has the right to propose a repurchase alternative following the identiﬁcation of a signiﬁcant defect. Fannie Mae will in good faith consider and respond to the lender’s proposed repurchase alternative.
Fannie Mae may oﬀer or decline to oﬀer the lender certain repurchase alternatives based on the lender’s counterparty status to the extent there are future obligations required as part of the repurchase alternative.
Published February 5, 2025
1058
Other factors to be considered by Fannie Mae may include, but are not limited to, the failure to maintain a quality loan origination process and the lender’s ability and willingness to comply with other provisions of the Lender Contract.
Step 4—Range of Possible Outcomes
As described in A2-3.2-02, Enforcement Relief for Breaches of Certain Representations and Warranties Related to Underwriting and Eligibility, certain loans may be eligible for enforcement relief under Version 2 of the framework based on the satisfactory conclusion of a full-ﬁle quality control review. The designation of a defect and the loan’s status as corrected or remedied will determine whether a loan is eligible for enforcement relief, as detailed below.
Finding: If the loan has had a full-ﬁle quality control review completed with only ﬁndings discovered, the loan is eligible for enforcement relief subject to any life-of-loan representations and warranties. If a loan has not had a full-ﬁle quality control review, it may still receive relief through other provisions under the framework.
PAL: If the PAL has had a full-ﬁle quality control review completed without the identiﬁcation of any signiﬁcant defects, the loan will receive enforcement relief subject to any life-of-loan representations and warranties, when the lender pays the LLPA. Loans that have not had a full-ﬁle quality control review, will not receive representation and warranty enforcement relief, even upon the payment of an LLPA, but may still receive relief through other provisions under the framework.
A lender may appeal a PAL designation. The appeals process for a PAL will result in one of the following outcomes:
rescission of the request for the payment of the LLPA, or
payment of the LLPA.
Signiﬁcant Defect: If the loan with a signiﬁcant defect has had a full-ﬁle quality control review, it will receive enforcement relief if
all signiﬁcant defects have been corrected; or
a repurchase alternative has been oﬀered and accepted, and fully executed and completed by the lender in compliance with any related terms, including the expiration of all applicable time frames.
The appeal process for mortgage loans with signiﬁcant defects may result in a range of outcomes, including:
rescission or close out, as appropriate, of the demand because all signiﬁcant defects have been corrected;
a deferred demand in the event that Fannie Mae cannot determine whether or not there has been a correction because the purchaser of the subject property or its title company or investor is the real party in interest to make the decision as to whether a title defect has been corrected;
agreement on a repurchase alternative; or
the lender fulﬁlls the demand.
If a repurchase alternative is oﬀered on a loan with a signiﬁcant defect, the lender can conclude that a full-ﬁle quality control review has been completed. However, if a repurchase alternative is oﬀered on a loan where a lender self-reports a defect, the lender cannot conclude that a full-ﬁle quality control review has occurred nor is

E-2-01, Required Custodial Documents (05/04/2022)
Introduction
Published February 5, 2025
1071
This exhibit contains information on the custodial documents required for all mortgages.
Required Custodial Documents
Required Custodial Documents
Custodial documents are the legal documents pertaining to a mortgage that the document custodian takes into physical possession when Fannie Mae purchases or securitizes a mortgage.
The following mortgage documents (when applicable) are required for all mortgages.
Requirement
Description
A document that contains the following:
lender name and contact information;
Cover letter
lender loan number;
property address; and
a list of the documents that are being included in the submission package
(documents listed below).
The original note endorsed “in blank” and without recourse and there is no break in
the chain of endorsements.
Note
For MERS registered loans, the MIN should be added to the upper right-hand corner of
the note and must be part of the electronic data delivery. The MIN must be registered
prior to delivery.
Modiﬁcations
Originals of any instruments that modify the terms and conditions of the mortgage
note (such as a modiﬁcation agreement or an ARM addendum).
Repair rider
A Repair Rider or Addendum if a set-aside for repairs is required.
A copy of the applicable power of attorney, if an attorney-in-fact signed the mortgage
note (or any other acceptable alternative for the mortgage note) on a borrower’s
behalf. If applicable law requires an original power of attorney for enforcement or
foreclosure purposes, the document custodian must hold the original rather than a
Power of
copy. If applicable law requires recordation of the power of attorney, it must be
attorney
recorded. The name(s) on the power of attorney must match the name(s) on the note
and must be dated such that it was valid at the time the note was executed. The
power of attorney must be notarized. If a power of attorney is used because the lender
determines such use is required by applicable law, the lender must include a written
statement that explains the circumstances.

practice) to show that the property is free of waste contamination and is
being operated in an environmentally safe manner?
2. Are there any obvious high-risk neighbors in adjacent properties
engaged in producing, storing, or transporting hazardous waste,
chemicals, or substances?
Note: If the answer to question 1 is “yes” and the answer to question 2 is
“no,” stop here because, for underwriting purposes, the property will be
acceptable from the standpoint of waste site contamination. Otherwise,
answer the questions below.
3. Was the site ever used for research, industrial, or military purposes
during the last 30 years?
4. Has any of the site space ever been leased to commercial tenants who

stressed vegetation, stained soil, open or leaking containers, foul fumes or
smells, oily ponds, etc.)?
Note: If the answer to any of the questions from 2 through 7 is “yes” or “don’t know,” then the property
either fails or needs a Phase II assessment conducted. If the answers to all of the questions 2 through 7 are
“no,” the property, for underwriting purposes, will be acceptable from the standpoint of waste site
contamination.

E-2-04, Signature Requirements for Mortgages to Inter Vivos
Revocable Trusts (02/27/2018)
Introduction This exhibit describes signature requirements for mortgages to revocable trusts, including:
Signature Requirements for California Use of a Signature Addendum to Note for Mortgages to Inter Vivos Revocable Trusts Form of Signature Required on Mortgage Note for an Institutional Trustee and for an Individual Trustee Who Is Not Both a Settlor and a Credit Applicant Form of Signature Required on Mortgage Note for an Individual Trustee Who Is Both a Settlor and a Credit Applicant Form of Signature Required on Security Instrument for All Trustees Form of Settlor/Credit Applicant’s Signature Acknowledgment Required on Security Instrument Optional Limitation on Trust Liability Example Signature Requirements for Inter Vivos Revocable Trusts
Signature Requirements for California
The forms of signature shown below are appropriate for California mortgages. Under California law, the term “settlor” refers to the individual(s) establishing the trust; therefore, Fannie Mae uses this terminology in the signature forms and in their related instructions. Fannie Mae has also used the term “credit applicant” to refer to an individual whose credit is used to qualify for the mortgage. A lender that originates mortgages to inter vivos revocable trusts secured by properties in a state other than California is responsible for making any modiﬁcations (including the use of diﬀerent terminology, if appropriate) needed to conform these signature forms to those that are customary for that state and will be held fully accountable for the use of any invalid signature form(s).
Use of a Signature Addendum to Note for Mortgages to Inter Vivos Revocable Trusts
Fannie Mae prefers that all signatures appear on the note itself; however, in certain situations the lender may decide that using a separate attachment for some of the signatures on the note is warranted. (An example is if there is not room for all of the signatures on the note itself.) In these situations, the lender may use a separate attachment or addendum (sometimes referred to as an allonge) for the borrower signatures, so long as the following requirements are met:
All individual borrower(s) must sign the note itself; lenders may use a signature addendum for trustee signatures.
Published February 5, 2025
1087
The form and content of the signature addendum used must comply with all applicable state, local and federal laws governing the use of an allonge and result in an enforceable and proper signature on the note.
The addendum must be permanently aﬃxed to the related note and must clearly identify the note by referencing at least the name of the borrower, the date of the note, the amount of the note, and the address of the security property.
The note must clearly and accurately reference the attached signature addendum.
Fannie Mae’s status as a “holder in due course” must not be impaired.
The lender must indemnify Fannie Mae (as described in A2-1-03, Indemniﬁcation for Losses), for any losses incurred by Fannie Mae as a result of the use of a signature addendum.
Form of Signature Required on Mortgage Note for an Institutional Trustee and for an Individual Trustee Who Is Not Both a Settlor and a Credit Applicant
Each institutional trustee of the inter vivos revocable trust and each individual trustee of the inter vivos revocable trust who is not both a settlor and a credit applicant must sign the mortgage note (and any necessary addendum), using a signature block substantially similar to the following, inserted in the Borrower’s Signature lines:
_______________________________________, as Trustee of the _________ [Complete Legal Name of Trust] Trust under trust instrument dated ___________________, __________.
Form of Signature Required on Mortgage Note for an Individual Trustee Who Is Both a Settlor and a Credit Applicant
Each individual trustee of the inter vivos revocable trust who is both a settlor and a credit applicant must sign the mortgage note (and any necessary addendum), using a signature block substantially similar to the following, inserted in the Borrower’s Signature lines:
_________________________________________, individually and as Trustee of the _________ [Complete Legal Name of Trust] Trust under trust instrument dated _____________, __________.
Form of Signature Required on Security Instrument for All Trustees
Each trustee of the inter vivos revocable trust must sign the security instrument (and any necessary rider), using a signature block substantially similar to the following, inserted in the Borrower’s Signature lines:
_______________________________________, as Trustee of the _________ [Complete Legal Name of Trust] Trust under trust instrument dated ___________________, __________.
Form of Settlor/Credit Applicant’s Signature Acknowledgment Required on Security Instrument
Published February 5, 2025
1088
The following must be added to the security instrument (and any necessary rider) following the Borrower’s Signature lines (and then must be signed by each settlor of the inter vivos revocable trust who is a credit applicant):
BY SIGNING BELOW, the undersigned, Settlor(s) of the_______________________ [Complete Legal Name of Trust] Trust under trust instrument dated _________, ______________, acknowledges all of the terms and covenants contained in this Security Instrument and any rider(s) thereto and agrees to be bound thereby. _________________________________ (Seal) Trust Settlor.
Optional Limitation on Trust Liability
Whenever the trustee of an inter vivos revocable trust is required to execute the note on behalf of such trust, in accordance with B8-5-02, Inter Vivos Revocable Trust Mortgage Documentation and Signature Requirements, language substantially similar to the following may be added to such trustee’s signature:
...but solely for the limited purpose of supporting the Trust’s granting of a lien in the property pursuant to the Security Instrument. The foregoing Trust has no personal obligation hereunder for payment of any sums secured by the Security Instrument.
Example Signature Requirements for Inter Vivos Revocable Trusts
The following table provides guidance on how the note and the security instrument should be executed in various situations, including those involving inter vivos revocable trusts.

If Seller fails to comply with the preceding sentence with respect to a Mortgage Loan, Servicer shall notify Fannie Mae, to initiate the repurchase process with respect to such Mortgage Loan. At no time shall Servicer be made to advance funds to reinstate any Private Mortgage Insurance Policy or pass-through to Fannie Mae any losses due to reasons stated in this subsection. If Servicer is notiﬁed of a rescission of the Private Mortgage Insurance Policy, Seller shall reimburse Servicer for any amounts due within ﬁfteen (15) Business Days of receipt of request for reimbursement from Servicer, provided such policy cannot be reinstated.
(vi) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7.4, if Fannie Mae requires Seller to repurchase a Mortgage Loan that was sold to Fannie Mae in a bifurcated SMP transaction, the parties agree and acknowledge that such repurchase shall be handled in accordance with the procedures and requirements speciﬁed in the Servicing Guide with respect to repurchase obligations related to bifurcated mortgage loans.

MBS margin
One of the factors used to establish the pool accrual rate for an ARM MBS pool on each interest rate change date.

For weighted-average ARM MBS pools, the MBS margin may be a ﬁxed margin that the lender speciﬁes or a weighted-average margin. A “ﬁxed” MBS margin is attained by varying the servicing fee for individual mortgages to equalize the diﬀerences in their mortgage margins. A “weighted-average” MBS margin is attained by reducing the various mortgage margins by the applicable guaranty fee and a ﬁxed servicing fee that the lender speciﬁes, thus developing a diﬀerent MBS margin for each mortgage.
